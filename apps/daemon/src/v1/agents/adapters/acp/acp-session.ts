/**

 * turn itself, so bounding it would give up on an agent that is working —
 * that is what `spawn-cli.ts`'s turn deadline already answers, measured
 * against SILENCE rather than against length. `initialize` / `session` /
 * `session_load` are the handshake: a reply that never comes leaves nothing to
 * run the turn on, so expiring one would emit a notice and change nothing.
 *
 * What is left is the two kinds that can HOLD a prompt: the model and parameter
 * frames, sent one at a time with the prompt behind them
 * (`AcpTurnDriver.configSteps`), where a reply that never arrives strands every
 * frame queued after it and the prompt — silently, a held turn emitting nothing
 * at all, until the turn-level silence deadline gives up on it half an hour
 * later. Expiring turns that into a notice plus a turn running on the agent's
 * own settings, which is what a REFUSAL of the same frame already produces.
 *
 * `set_mode` is absent for the reason the handshake frames are: it is not in
 * that queue, so it cannot strand anything, and arming it would only buy a
 * chance to narrate a turn that had already run on. Being listed here is not
 * on its own permission to speak — the last frame usually does not hold the

 * second answering a codeword only the first had been told. What stood in the
 * way was not the protocol but this client: nearly every field of the old class
 * was per-TURN and said so in its own doc comments, harmless only while a
 * session was exactly one turn. `imageBlocks` and the turn's `input` were the
 * sharpest — both fixed at construction, so a second turn would have re-sent
 * the first turn's attachments and, worse, its prompt.
 *
 * Resetting ~20 fields between turns was the alternative, and it is the shape
 * this deliberately avoids: it makes "remember to reset" the invariant, and the
