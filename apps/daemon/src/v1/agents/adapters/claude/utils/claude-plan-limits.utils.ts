 * its profile touched in the last seven days, for a `behaviors` block neither
 * reader looks at. Read out of the 2.1.284 binary: the reply is
 * `Promise.all([<the usage endpoint>, <that scan>])`, so the scan alone sets
 * how long the answer takes. On a profile holding 1.2GB of such transcripts it
 * cost 1.1–2.9s against 1ms for a cached endpoint reading, idle — and it is
 * also what made the plan half of the readout fail OFTEN, where the context
 * half beside it answered: a busy process mid-turn, beside other agents writing
 * those same transcripts, ran it past `CLAUDE_PLAN_LIMITS_TIMEOUT_MS`, and
 * the "taken again while this stays open" retry only started the scan over.
 * The `rate_limits` it returns are the same either way (measured side by side
