 * `-p --output-format stream-json` writes to stdout. That is the fact this file
 * rests on and the reason claude needs no protocol call to be imported: the
 * transcript is already in the vocabulary {@link mapClaudeMessage} speaks, so an
 * imported thread is built by the same mapper as a live one rather than by a
 * second reader that could disagree with it about what a row means.
 *
 * The directory NAME is deliberately never parsed. It is the cwd with its
 * separators flattened to `-`, which is lossy (`/a/b-c` and `/a-b/c` collide)
 * and undocumented; every `cwd` here is read from the file's own lines, where
 * the CLI writes it verbatim on each one.
 *
 * Scale is the other constraint. The author's own profile holds 2,448 sessions
 * over 1.7GB, and one session runs to 11MB — so nothing here reads a whole file
 * to answer "what is this about": the listing stats every candidate (cheap) and
 * opens only as far as the first user message, bounded by
 * {@link CLAUDE_SESSION_HEAD_BUDGET_BYTES}.
