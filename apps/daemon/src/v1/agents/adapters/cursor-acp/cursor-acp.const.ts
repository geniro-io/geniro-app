// ── `cursor-agent mcp list` ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This adapter deliberately carried NO const file until now: every static fact
// about the CLI was a value only `getConfig()` read, so it belonged inline
// beside the field it answered. The listing changes that — the status markers
// and the empty-folder sentence are read by BOTH the parser and the adapter,
// and two readers of one string is exactly what a name exists to prevent.
//
// Everything below was captured from the real binary, version
// `2026.07.23-e383d2b`, and the verbatim output is kept alongside the
// milestone that added it. The CLI has no machine-readable mode for this
// listing — `mcp list` takes no options at all — so this reads its prose and
// is version-volatile by construction.

 * Deadline for that listing. Same budget claude's gets, and for the same

 * unreachable HTTP one costs its own connect timeout before the CLI answers.
 *
 * Three configured servers (two unreachable) took 3.4s when probed, so this is
 * headroom rather than an expectation. Bounded ABOVE by the renderer's own 30s
 * per-request budget (`daemon-api.ts` REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS) — at 30s here the
 * client would always abort first and the daemon's "could not read" sentence
 * would never reach the panel.

 * Row status markers — the whole vocabulary the CLI printed.
 *
 * A row is `<name>: <status>` and nothing else. Unlike claude, cursor prints no
 * command column and no transport, so there is no structural delimiter inside a
 * row: recognising the status IS the only way to tell a row from a line of
 * prose. That is why these three strings carry more weight here than their
 * claude counterparts do, and why an unrecognised status costs the whole
 * listing rather than one badge — see `parseCursorMcpList`.
 *
 * `Error:` keeps its colon: the reason follows it (`Error: Connection failed`),
 * and both a missing stdio binary and an unreachable HTTP URL produced that
 * identical wording, so the reason is coarse but it is all the CLI gives.
