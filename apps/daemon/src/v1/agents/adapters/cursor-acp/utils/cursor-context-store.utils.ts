/**
 * Reading cursor's OWN context accounting out of the session store it keeps on
 * disk.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A PROTOCOL CALL. The CLI tells an ACP client
 * nothing about its window — measured twice, most recently on 2026-08-15
 * against a raw frame capture of a real tool-using turn (see the doc block at
 * `usage.breakdownUnavailableReason` in the adapter). But it is not that the
 * figures do not exist: the CLI writes a complete breakdown into the session
 * store for every turn, which is what its own TUI renders. geniro already owns
 * that directory — `<configDir>/acp-sessions` is a symlink to
 * `<userData>/cursor-sessions` so a session survives the per-turn profile — so
 * reading it needs no new access, only a parser.
 *
 * WHAT IS THERE, probed on 2026.08.11-e8db854. One SQLite file per session
 * (`store.db`) holding two tables: `meta`, whose single row is a hex-encoded
 * JSON header carrying `latestRootBlobId`, and `blobs`, a content-addressed
 * store. The root blob is protobuf-encoded and carries, in one sub-message:
 *
 *     field 1 (varint)  tokens used          119801
 *     field 2 (varint)  the model's window   300000
 *     field 3 (repeated message, one per category)
 *         field 1 (string)  key      "system_prompt"
 *         field 2 (string)  label    "System prompt"
 *         field 3 (varint)  tokens   5214
 *         field 4 (varint)  characters 13858
 *
 * Eight categories on that reading — system_prompt, tools, rules, skills, mcp,
 * subagents, summarized_conversation, conversation — and their tokens sum to
 * EXACTLY the used total, which is the arithmetic this parser re-checks rather
 * than trusts.
 *
 * NO SCHEMA IS ASSUMED BEYOND THAT SHAPE. Field numbers are read structurally
 * and the breakdown is located by its own contents (a message holding rows of
 * string/string/varint), not by a byte offset — so a re-ordered or extended
 * message still parses, and one that has genuinely changed yields null rather
 * than a wrong number. Same expiry warning as every other probe block in this
 * adapter: an observation of one build. The header also carries a
 * `blobEncryptionKey`, unused on this build — blobs are plaintext — which is
 * the most likely way this stops working, and it stops by returning null.

 * hostile blob can present arbitrarily deep nesting, and the walk is
 * synchronous on a request path.
