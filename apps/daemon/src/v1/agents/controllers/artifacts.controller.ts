/**
 * The page one published artifact IS — the URL the renderer frames.
 *
 * Kept OUT of the OpenAPI document, like `McpController`: it answers with an
 * HTML document rather than a wire shape, so there is nothing for the generated
 * client to describe and no reason for the renderer to reach it except as an
 * `<iframe src>`. That is also why the generated client needs no regeneration
 * for this feature — the descriptor the renderer needs rides the transcript row
 * it already receives.
 *
 * **Why the key is a QUERY parameter and not a bearer header.** An `<iframe
 * src>` cannot set a request header; there is no API for it. So this one route
 * sits outside the global bearer gate (`PUBLIC_PREFIXES` in
 * `auth/token.guard.ts`) and authenticates on a per-artifact capability minted
 * by the store — 256 bits, handed to the renderer inside the transcript row it
 * already receives over the authenticated channel, and never written to argv or
 * a log. The check is not skippable by a mistake here: the only way to read a
 * page is {@link ArtifactStoreService.read}, which TAKES the key as an argument
 * and compares it in constant time, so there is no code path that reads a
 * document without presenting one.
 *
 * The launch token is deliberately NOT accepted as an alternative: it would
 * have to travel in the frame's URL to be usable, and the master credential of
 * the whole daemon does not belong in a URL handed to a page an agent wrote.
