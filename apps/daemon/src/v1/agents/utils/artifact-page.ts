/**
 * The Content-Security-Policy the artifact page carries as its OWN response
 * header — the thing that makes agent-authored script safe to run at all.
 *
 * This is NOT the renderer's policy and does not inherit from it. A framed
 * document's policy comes from its own response headers, which is precisely why
 * the page is served over loopback rather than put in an `<iframe srcdoc>`: a
 * srcdoc document INHERITS the embedder's policy, and the app's is
 * `default-src 'self'` with no `script-src`, so the agent's script would simply
 * never run.
 *
 * `default-src 'none'` is the base: no fetch, no XHR, no WebSocket, no remote
 * image, no beacon, no frame. The two `'unsafe-inline'` grants are what the
 * feature IS — an agent writes one file, so its style and script are inline by
 * construction.
 *
 * The one way OUT is a fixed list of public library CDNs — scripts,
 * stylesheets and fonts only — plus Google Fonts. That is what lets a page draw
 * with ECharts, Mermaid or Tailwind instead of hand-rolled SVG, and it is the
 * list Claude Code's own artifacts allow, so an agent's habits carry over. The
 * price is that such a page does not work offline, which is the user's call.
 * It opens no channel to talk BACK: script still cannot `fetch`, and a library
 * from a CDN runs under the same `connect-src` silence as the page's own code.
 * The page URL carries the per-artifact key, which is why the route also sends
 * `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` — without it every CDN request would log it.
 * The hosts are spelled out in each directive rather than shared through a
 * constant because the twin parser reads string literals.
 *
 * `frame-ancestors` is deliberately ABSENT. The embedder is this app's own
 * renderer, whose origin is `file://` in a packaged build and a dev-server URL
 * under `pnpm dev`; naming either would break the other, and a wrong value
 * breaks the feature outright rather than degrading. What actually keeps the
 * page private is the per-artifact key — 256 bits, minted by the store, never
 * in argv or a log — so a page that cannot be addressed cannot be framed.
 *
 * `base-uri` and `form-action` are pinned to `'none'` because `default-src`
 * does not cover them: without the first, a `<base>` tag could re-point every
 * relative URL in the document, and without the second a form could POST the
 * page's contents somewhere even though script cannot.
 *
 * TWIN PARSER: `ARTIFACT_FILE_CSP` in
 * `apps/ui/src/renderer/chats/artifact-export.ts` restates this policy as the
 * `<meta>` a SAVED copy of the page carries — a file has no response header,
 * and the renderer cannot import daemon source. A directive changed here must
 * change there; `artifact-export.spec.ts` reads this array out of this file
 * and fails when the two disagree, so keep it one string literal per line.
 *
 * TWIN PARSER: `ARTIFACT_CDN_HOSTS` in `apps/ui/src/main/network-lockdown.ts`
 * — the Electron main process refuses every other host at the resolver and
 * the proxy, so a host added here and not there never loads in the app.
 * `network-lockdown.spec.ts` reads this array too.

 * and this writes them onto `documentElement`, so a page that reached for
 * `var(--geniro-fg)` is painted in the user's actual theme and follows it when
 * they switch. The values have to arrive by message rather than be baked into
 * the response, because the daemon cannot read the renderer's stylesheets —

 *
 * And it REPORTS its height, so the frame can be sized to its content instead
 * of scrolling inside a box. `ResizeObserver` covers the case a load event
 * cannot: a page whose own script draws after first paint, which is most of
 * the interesting ones.
 *
 * Once the theme is written it fires `ARTIFACT_THEME_EVENT` on `window`, which
 * is how the page runtime (`artifact-runtime.ts`) knows to re-theme the charts
 * and diagrams it drew with the previous values.

 * sandbox grants the page no popups, so this is the only way a link leaves the
 * frame.

/**
 * The base styling every artifact starts from — in the app's frame AND in the

 *
 * Every value is a `var(--geniro-*)` with a fallback, so the page is legible
 * before the host's theme message arrives and if it never does.
 *
 * The two RESET lines are floors against the two ways an agent's page routinely
 * overflows its frame: a width plus padding measured content-box, and an image
 * wider than the column. Both are what every modern stylesheet already
 * declares, so a page that sets them itself sets the same values; a page that
 * forgot them is the one this catches.
 *
 * The CENTRING lines are the third floor. An agent routinely caps its reading
 * column on `body` (`max-width: 880px`) while also writing `margin: 0`, which
 * pins the column to the left edge once the frame is wider than the cap — the
 * full-screen view, every time. A `margin-inline: auto` here would lose to that
 * `margin: 0`, so the centring lives on `html`, which pages leave alone: a flex
 * row that centres its one child. `flex: 1` keeps an uncapped body exactly as
 * wide as before, and `min-width: 0` keeps a wide table from stretching the body
 * past the frame, as block layout never did. A page that styles `html` or
 * `body` itself still wins.
 *
 * How a bare element looks is {@link ELEMENT_STYLE}'s, one layer lower.
 * Everything else about how a page LOOKS is the agent's, and is asked for where
 * the agent can act on it — the `show_artifact` tool's own description — rather
 * than legislated here, since a page's own CSS wins by construction and a floor
 * cannot reach inside its markup.
 *
 * The GROUND is not here, because the two readings need different ones: see

/**
 * What a bare HTML element looks like before the page styles it — headings,

 * tokens instead of the browser's defaults.
 *
 * MEASURED, not imagined: a survey of the agents' own pages found browser
 * defaults leaking through wherever a page's CSS stopped short — the native ▶
 * marker on 22 of 23 pages with a `<details>`, the system checkbox and select,
 * a table with no cell padding. Every page sets SOME of these and not others,
 * so a floor that answers each element on its own is what makes the rest
 * consistent.
 *
 * It sits in `geniro-elements`, the LOWEST layer ({@link ARTIFACT_LAYER_ORDER}):
 * below Tailwind's preflight, so a Tailwind page gets the reset its utilities
 * are written against (`ul` without bullets, `h1` at the body size), and below
 * every rule the page writes, so a page that styles an element keeps its own
 * look. It only fills what nothing else set.
 *
 * The GUARDS at the end are the exception, and are deliberately few:
 * `!important` in the lowest layer outranks every normal rule anywhere, so they
 * hold even against the page's own CSS. Each one undoes a rule the survey found
 * agents writing, and which has no right use on the element it guards:
 *  - `list-style-position: outside` on a `summary` hangs the marker into the
 *    box's padding, on top of its border (the screenshot that opened this);
 *  - `word-break: break-all` reaching a `code` breaks an id or a hash in the
 *    middle ("cw_case_switch_selecti | on") even where it fits its line.
 *    `overflow-wrap` is left to the page: forcing `break-word` stopped a
 *    table column shrinking below its longest token, which overflows a
 *    narrow frame.
 *
 * Controls get the app's chrome only when they carry no class: a page that
 * classed its own tabs or segmented buttons drew them, and a radius or a
