/**
 * Whether a permission request names geniro's OWN artifact tool.
 *
 * Auto-approved on the family's reading: what the agent is asking to run is the
 * act of publishing a page into this app's own panel. The document reaches a
 * sandboxed frame rather than the user's disk, and its CSP opens no channel of
 * its own — so a card guarding it would fire on every artifact for one residual
 * risk, accepted by decision rather than overlooked: a page may load libraries
 * from the fixed CDNs, and the URL of such a request can carry data the page
 * holds — into the CDN's logs and, on jsDelivr, into the per-package request
 * statistics an npm publisher can read — in every approval mode.
 *
 * How the pair is matched belongs to {@link isHostToolCall}.
