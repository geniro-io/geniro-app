 * {@link StandingHostQuestion} for the measurement that makes a card outlive
 * the agent call that raised it, and `chat.types.ts` for why the span is the
 * turn's.
 *
 * A card is keyed by what it ASKS — every word it shows — so a re-ask carrying
 * the identical title and questions finds the card already up and adopts it,
 * while a rewording is a different question and gets its own card. That is the
 * honest reading: the person is being asked something else.
 *
 * It holds no persistence and no registry. Everything here is the protocol
 * alone, so the states two racing agent calls can put one card into are
 * reachable from a spec instead of only by driving a whole turn.
