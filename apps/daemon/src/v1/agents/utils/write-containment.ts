/**
 * Where a write to `target` would land relative to `root`: `inside` it,
 * `outside` it by its path alone, or outside it only once links are followed
 * (`through-link`). A path relative to `root` is read against it.
 *
 * The ONE answer for every write geniro lets through without the user looking —
 * a patch the user accepted (`applyHostPatch`) and a codex file change
 * `acceptEdits` takes unasked — so a hardening lands in both at once. What no
 * judgement of a PATH can see is a hard link, which is {@link hasOtherHardLinks}'s
 * to answer.
 *
 * A path is followed the way the kernel follows it ({@link landing}), and it is
 * followed TWICE, because a writer may take either of two readings of one
 * string: AS WRITTEN, where a `..` after a link steps out of the link's target,
 * and RESOLVED first, where `..` is collapsed before the kernel sees the path —
 * what `path.resolve` does, and what codex's own patch applier was measured to
 * do. `inside` only when both land inside. A caller that knows its writer
 * resolves first passes the resolved path, which makes the two one reading
 * (`applyHostPatch`); a CLI's writer is not ours to know, so its raw path must
 * pass both.

/**
 * Whether the existing file `target` names, read against `root`, shares its

 * place {@link landing} puts a write to each, which is what
 * {@link writeContainment} judged: a `link/..` lands on one file as written and
 * on another once collapsed, and a directory that does not exist yet before a
 * `..` is walked there, where a stat of the raw string would stop at the gap.
 *
 * A hard link reads as an ordinary file inside the folder, yet writing it
 * writes whatever else shares its inode — possibly a file outside. Nothing in
 * the path says so, which is why {@link writeContainment} cannot. A link at the
 * name is followed, since the file it lands on is the one written; a path that
 * names nothing, or a directory, is not one. A link that leads nowhere, or a
 * path that cannot be examined at all, is answered as if it were: this guards a
 * write nobody looks at, so it fails toward a card.
 *
 * Synchronous for `writeContainment`'s reason. `applyHostPatch` asks the same
 * question of the file it has open; a caller that only decides beforehand, as
 * codex's auto-accept must, can only ask it of the path.
