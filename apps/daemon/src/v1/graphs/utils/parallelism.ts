 * machine it was reported from: a Manager fanning out to five workers ran four
 * of them and queued the rest while the session registry, already derived,
 * would have kept sixteen. So it is the SAME curve as

 * kept session is — never below the old flat value. Derived from TOTAL memory
 * for the reason that function gives: the same computer gets the same answer
 * on every launch.
 *
 * Two pools of this size can exceed the registry's ceiling between them; the
 * registry goes over its ceiling rather than refuse a turn when every session
 * is busy, so that costs memory, never a deadlock.
