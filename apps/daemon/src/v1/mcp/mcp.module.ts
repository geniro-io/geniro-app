/**
 * geniro's own MCP surface: the per-run endpoint (`/v1/mcp/<runId>/<nodeId>`)
 * and every tool it serves.
 *
 * Its own module because it sits ABOVE the two it serves: the render family's
 * brokers live in {@link AgentsModule}, the call runtime and the board's
 * rendezvous in {@link TeamsModule}, and the host needs both — and the
 * team history an analysis reads in {@link StatsModule}, which sits above
 * those two. Nothing imports this module back.
 *
 * The tools are plain classes, one directory each under `tools/`, built by ONE
 * factory so their listing order is written in one place
 * ({@link createMcpTools}).
