 * A run's POLLED spend as the ledger rows that carry it — one per local

 * has priced nothing on this run.
 *
 * A polled-spend CLI (`AdapterConfig.usage.polledSpend` — cursor today) prices
 * nothing on its own wire, so its money reaches this app only through an
 * account poll that writes onto `Run.polledCostCents`, split by day and model
 * in `Run.polledSpendBuckets`. Those columns are destroyed with the run, so
 * Stats reading them straight off the run row would take a deleted chat's whole
 * bill out of every lifetime figure, which is exactly the loss this ledger
 * exists to prevent for turns. Copying them here is what lets them outlive it.
 *
 * Shared by the live recorder and the boot sweep, on `usageDimensions`' rule:
 * the two must write identical rows for the same run, or the figure would
 * depend on which of them got there last.
 *
 * - One row per bucket, so the Stats page draws the bill on the DAYS it was
 *   spent and under the MODELS that spent it. Before, one row per run placed a
 *   month of a team's cursor bill on its last day under no model — the
 *   "By model" list's largest entry was a blank. Rows are keyed
 *   `(runId, POLLED_SPEND_SEQ - i)` over the buckets in key order, and the
 *   whole set is replaced on every write (`UsageEventDao.recordPolledSpend`).
 * - A run with no buckets (priced before they were kept) keeps ONE row on its
 *   last activity, the approximation that row always was.
 * - A row the account named no model for is filed under `reportedModel`.
 * - `agentKind` is the CLI whose money this is, resolved by the caller
 *   (`polledAgentKind`) and never read off the run alone: a TEAM run — where
 *   a polled node's spend comes from — has no agent of its own.
 * - Every figure but the cost is null — the poll measures money and nothing
 *   else, and null means NOT MEASURED here as everywhere in this table.
