Main process (git, task worktrees, **Daemon supervision**, **Terminal panel**, **LAN gateway**), app updates and security: `apps/ui/src/main/AGENTS.md`. macOS packaging: `.claude/rules/packaging-config.md`.

### Renderer shell

- The phone page is not a secure context: the gateway serves plain http. Use `renderer/random-id.ts`, never `crypto.randomUUID`, and `renderer/clipboard.ts`, never `navigator.clipboard`. eslint bans both direct uses.
- A new secure-context-only API passes every test and fails only on the phone.
- Stale bundle: `renderer/stale-bundle.ts` → `reloadForNewBundle` reloads once, from whichever of three places sees a chunk-load failure first: `vite:preloadError`, the root `ErrorBoundary`, or `boot-app.tsx`. A second page failing within 30s shows the error instead of looping.
- Phone layout (below `sm`) is pages under `components/bottom-tab-bar.tsx`.
  - Each detail page holds one marked browser-history entry (`components/use-phone-back-entry.ts`). Every way back goes through `history.back()`.
  - The shell's hash sync must pass `history.state` through `replaceState`, never `null`.
- The window never scrolls (`html, body, #root { overflow: clip }`). A full-screen view scrolls an outer pane and caps width with a separate inner column, never with one element.
- jsdom computes no layout. Specs pin the DOM fact that decides a layout (which element scrolls, the class, document order), never a measured position.
- Title bar (`components/title-bar.tsx`, one band above all columns):
  - `TRAFFIC_LIGHT_*` and `TITLEBAR_CONTENT_INSET` live in `shared/contracts.ts`, because main positions the buttons and the renderer reserves room for them. Re-measure before changing them.
  - `trafficLightPosition.y` and the bar's `h-11` move together.
  - The title bar is the only drag region (`.app-drag`). Any control inside it needs `.app-no-drag`.
  - The title is centred on the window, never measured from a column's width. Never put a flex `gap` on the bar row. The title bar is the one header band: no per-column header rows and no divider.
  - The debug log is ⌥⌘L only.
  - `chats/waiting-status.tsx` counts what waits on the user (asking, failed, unread); a press or ⌘J (`chats/use-next-waiting-shortcut.ts`) opens the next one. Window-wide chords go through `components/use-global-chord.ts`.
- A Settings note under a control is one line: what flipping it does, plus the one consequence nobody would guess.

**Projects (`projects/`, `#/projects[/<id>]`):** a gallery of cards (`projects-library.tsx`, `project-card.tsx`; a card opens the page) and one project's page (`project-detail.tsx`: a hero, then `ProjectSection` cards) — name (renamed from the hero's pencil), folder and card key, the description and the instruction blocks (`project-instructions-form.tsx` over the shared `components/instruction-blocks.tsx` the team's Instructions card uses too, with no audience; a block a daemon refusal would meet holds the save, `project-instruction-blocks.ts`; autosaved through `useDebouncedPersist`, each write quoting `instructionsRevision`; a `409 PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS_DRIFT` keeps the typed text and offers a reload), its run configurations (created, edited, ordered and deleted there), its default agent or team (a section of its own: the board's cards and autopilot run as it, and picking the project in the new-chat composer preselects it — `projects/project-composer-target.ts`, a manual pick only) with a Team section when it is a team (`project-team-overrides.tsx`, below under _Teams_ → **Project overrides**), the overrides it kept of other teams (`listProjectTeamOverlays`, Remove), the autopilot, and the instruction size a run there carries per CLI (`POST /v1/projects/:projectId/instruction-sizes` over `use-project-instruction-sizes.ts`: the preamble, the user's custom instructions and reply language, the project's text and the memory index a run there would snapshot, read again on a saved name or text change and a settings write). A card's and the page's running and waiting counts are the daemon's queue read (`use-project-queues.ts` over `readProjectQueue`): a project is re-read after its own task changes (the daemon also announces a card whose own run starts or settles where it stands) and any change to it but a text edit; every project after a reconnect; the page reads only its own project's queue. A queue not read yet draws no figure. The list is the daemon's, re-read on `projects_changed` (`daemon-client.ts` `onProjectsChanged`) and after a reconnect; the page also re-reads after its own name, run-settings and autopilot writes. Pickers read `useProjectRefs` (id, name, folder), which skips a `textsOnly` event and keeps its value while those three are equal, so an autosave of a project's texts neither re-reads nor re-renders Chats. The new-chat composer holds its project as `{projectId, source}` (`config` from an applied configuration, `manual` from its chip, `folder` from `GET /v1/projects/of-folder`): a chosen one outlives a folder change and is sent as chosen (the daemon passes over an id it no longer has), falls back to `folder` once the loaded list no longer holds it, the chip shows only when a project applies, `folder` sends nothing (the daemon resolves it the same way), a cleared chip sends an explicit null. A started thread's project is the run wire's `project`, drawn as a static shelf chip.

**Board (`tasks/`):**

- Card edits are optimistic (`useBoard.updateTask`). Never build the panel's fields from the saved card alone.
  - In-flight edits are re-applied over reloads.
  - An answer older than a newer edit is ignored.
  - A refused edit is undone only in fields that still hold what it wrote.
- The New task dialog stages pictures and files. `useBoard.createTask` creates the card without the staged references, writes the pictures, repoints the references, then binds files.
- The dialog is hidden, not unmounted, so its reset on open must also clear staged phone uploads.
- A paused autopilot (`autopilotIsPaused`: its breaker tripped, or `autopilotResumesAt` while a usage limit stands) draws its `AutopilotControl` on the every-project board too, one `named` chip per project. A limit's lapse announces nothing, so the board and `useProjects` re-read the list at the soonest `autopilotLimitUntil` (`use-autopilot-limit-lapse.ts`), re-armed on every answer.
- The "cannot start" popover offers the board's run settings only for a blocked `kind` they can answer (`FIXED_IN_RUN_SETTINGS`); the board re-reads the queue after the soonest blocked `retryInMs` (`soonestRetryInMs`), re-armed on every queue answer, since nothing announces a hold lapsing.

**Stats (`stats/`):**

- Chart colours come from `stats/charts/chart-theme.tsx` only. The transcript's chart card reuses it.
- Line counts are measured in the renderer per repository root and branch (`use-line-snapshots.ts`), against a daemon-held baseline.
  - The reads (`getGitHead`, `getChangesTotals`) are `denyRemotely`, and the hook is silent on a phone.
  - A git check that merely failed answers `null`. Never replace a baseline over a timeout.
  - Before the daemon stops, main asks windows to flush in-flight measurements (`line-measurement-flush.ts`).
- `dayRangeTitle` reads local days. Never take the day from `iso.slice(0, 10)`.
- `formatUsd` is pinned to `en-US`.
- `formatPercent` never rounds up to a whole the value did not reach.

### Design system

The rules live in `.claude/rules/renderer-*.md`; start from `renderer-components.md`, which also holds the catalog-coverage rule. Main-process and tooling facts they do not cover:

- The theme is applied by main, with no IPC channel. `Settings.theme` is read by `main/native-appearance.ts`, which sets `nativeTheme.themeSource`. That one write themes the OS chrome and drives the renderer's `prefers-color-scheme`.
- `applyTheme` is the only exported way to apply a theme, because it also repaints the window `backgroundColor` (`watchSystemAppearance`). Never export the bare OS write.
- `createWindow` reads `resolvedTheme` → `ThemeDescriptor.windowBackground` from `shared/themes.ts` before any stylesheet exists.
- Storybook is dev-only and binds `127.0.0.1` explicitly (its default would serve the workspace over the LAN).
- `.storybook/preview.tsx` drives `theme/apply-theme.ts` and never sets `data-theme` itself. It installs the `window.geniro` stub before any other import.
- xterm and ANSI output are themed from tokens (`terminal-theme.ts`, `--ansi-*`). `ESC[90m` means dim and must never map onto `--ansi-black`. A copy of command output hands over `stripAnsi(text)`.

### Chats

**The transcript is a window.** A chat opens on its newest page (`Settings.historyPageSize`, capped at `REMOTE_HISTORY_PAGE` in a browser through the gateway: `App` passes `transcriptPageCap`) and pages older through `beforeSeq`. Anything that describes the whole thread, a call conversation or an agent is read from the daemon, never folded from loaded `items` nor bounded by a capped listing (`.claude/rules/run-statistics.md`):

- Run state (`useRunState`, `GET /v1/chats/:runId/state`).
- Spend (`useChatTotals`, and the nodes route for teams).
- The timeline, artifacts list, task-list words (`withDurableTaskLists`), shells (`withDurableShells`), delegates (`withDurableDelegates`), and node liveness (`withDurableNodeStatus`).
- Worked time and tool count, which take the daemon's figure alone where it has one. A call card's clock is the daemon's `callFigures[].clock`, continued over the rows above its `throughSeq` (`chats/call-clock.ts`, twin of the daemon's `utils/call-clock.ts`): the call's open time, its waits on its own monitors and calls included and its waits on the user left out, so it runs while the card says `waiting` and is never replaced when a turn lands.
- In each case the turn in flight is added on top (`withLiveCost`, `openTurns`).

A team run's window is its OWN flow only:

- Every window PAGE read passes `conversation=root` (the daemon answers a chat, whose agent calls no one, with the whole run). A root page anchors what each call's FOLDED card is drawn from. The tail catch-up and the reconnect replay read the whole run since a cursor.
- A row whose `inCall` is a call id (`isCallRow`; the run's own flow carries null) never joins `items`. Both places a row can arrive split on it into `callRows` — `use-run-stream.ts`'s `ingest` (live rows and the replay) and `use-chat-run.ts`'s `catchUpTail` — and the stream's `structure` folds the anchors and the call rows as one. An opened call card reads its own conversation through `CallConversationPager` (`call=<id>`). What it read is forgotten on thread open and close, and on return to the tail, whose root pages skipped the calls' rows written meanwhile.
- A reader about a call's turns, cards, shells or pages reads `transcriptRows` (the window plus every structure row filed under a call — a page's card anchors, live rows, an opened card's pages), never `items` alone.

Anchors and run state:

- Anchors (`GET …/items` → `{items, anchors}`) are kept apart from `items`, laid in only where the transcript is folded, and never drawn as rows.
- Live rows ask for anchors through `chats/use-live-anchor-asks.ts`.
- Whatever replaces anchors calls `forget`. A page landing after a live answer merges.
- Rows refused by `addItem`'s away-from-tail guard bring no anchors.
- Never rebuild a call heuristically from its later rows: it draws ghost cards.
- `useRunState` re-reads on open, reconnect, a structural row or a status announce, never on an activity phrase. The window supplies details; the daemon decides what has ENDED: a shell, delegate or call the page reads as running that began at or before the read's `throughSeq` and that the read says is over, is over (`withoutDaemonEndedShells`, `applyDaemonReadings` in `durable-transcript.ts`, `callEndedPerDaemon`). The same read carries each delegate's whole-run tool count, which `applyDaemonReadings` lays on its card with the delegate's rows above `throughSeq` added. The open turns' unanswered calls (`openToolCalls`) are folded in with the page, so a foreground command shows while the reader is elsewhere. Open requests off the tail are the daemon's too.

Jumps (search, global search, timeline, the Agents chip) — `chats/use-transcript-jump.ts`, DOM contract in `chats/jump-target.ts`:

- Every row a jump can land on carries its seq (`data-transcript-seq` / `data-row-seq` / `data-call-seq`), a second row it draws (`data-seq-also`, a tool row's result) and a page-unique `data-jump-key`; the mark is matched on the key, never the seq (a turn and its first row share one). The anchor drawing the hit wins, innermost first; only without one, the nearest start below it.
- The folds a row is drawn inside (tool group, tool row, long reasoning, sub-agent block, call card) are found from the transcript's STRUCTURE (`chats/jump-folds.ts`), never from seq ranges — interleaved delegates span each other's seqs. They are opened through thread memory, then the row is landed on.
- A row filed under a call is located (one-row read), the window paged to its card, the card and every card around it opened and read back to the row (`loadThrough`), then the row is marked inside the card.

One home for each concern:

- The per-run stream is `chats/use-run-stream.ts`.
- A conversation drawn outside the chat screen — the builder's chat dock, a thread's or a team's analysis popup — is the chat screen itself: `Chats` with `hosted` (`chats/hosted-thread.ts`). Its run list is the one run the surface's `open` answers (`useChatRun`'s `pinned`), and it draws the thread alone: no list, no new-chat composer, no notifications, archive sweep, global search or Analyze. The surface gives its header controls, empty text, composer label and queue scope, and is told back through `onBeforeSend` (before every turn it starts: a message, a button press, a recommendations Apply, a Retry — `startHostedTurn`), `onWorkingChange`, `onAwaitingChange` and `onTurnSettled` (as a turn's ending arrives, before a queued message leaves behind it: `useChatRun`'s `onTurnEndRef`). `AnalysisDialog` takes the chat screen as `renderThread`, so the two modules do not import each other. Never write a second chat surface; a hosted surface that needs something is given it through `HostedThread`.
- Run-row fields from `run_status` are read by `chats/run-status-row.ts`.
- The message queue rules are in `chats/use-message-queue.ts`. Every queue persists (`queued-message-store.ts`): the chat screen's under one key, a hosted conversation's under its surface's own (`HostedThread.queueScope`), so closing the dock or a popup, or a reload, loses nothing — it goes out once the surface is back and its agent is free.
- `joinRun`/`leaveRun` both live in `use-chat-run.ts` (`activateRun`/`deactivateRun`), which holds one join of the open run (`heldRoomRef`). `DaemonClient` counts joins per run, so several chat screens share the socket's room and it is left only when the last one lets go.
- The chat screen's composer text is a store (`chats/composer-text.ts`), never state on `Chats`: the field subscribes to the text (`MessageComposer`'s `text`), the screen only to facts it draws (`useComposerTextFact`: is there text, the `/` query), and send paths read `get()` at the press. Typing must not re-render the screen (pinned in `Chats.spec.tsx`).
- `Chats` stays mounted across nav switches. Read settings at the moment a run is created (`renderer/run-settings.ts` → `currentRunSettings()`, the one reader every renderer run start uses: chat, team run, analysis, a card's run, the builder's chat; main's autopilot normalises through the same `runSettingsOf` in `shared/contracts.ts`), never from cached state. Re-read lists such as fast actions when the screen becomes active again.

**Sending and the queue:**

- The whole send/queue decision is `followUpDelivery`/`parkedReason` in `chats/follow-up-delivery.ts`, pinned row by row in its spec. The send path, button label, hover sentence and placeholder all read it.
- Principle: a message goes straight in when the agent will read it soon, and queues when the agent is busy with something that blocks reading.
- `sendFollowUp` queues when the agent is working or when the queue is non-empty. Never decide on `streaming` alone.
- Queueing behind an idle run kicks the drain. Never kick it while the agent is working.
- RUN_BUSY from the daemon means queue and retry. The daemon is the fact, and the renderer's `streaming` is only a belief.
- The composer refuses no geniro command itself.
- Whether a unit is foreground or background is the CLI's own word, as announced by the daemon. Never guess it.
- A Stop leaves the queue standing on every surface, the hosted chats included: only `settleReleasesQueue` decides whether a settle drains. The head waits for its Send.
- A held turn (`holdingFor`) is not a working agent. The live announce drains once, on the transition into held. `queueMayDrainAfterReplay` treats a held run as drainable.
- A team whose manager has ended its turn (`rootsWorking = 0`) takes a message at once.
- While the agent is producing its reply, a typed message queues whatever background work is out. Background sub-agents and a detached command (`subagentsOut`, `shellsOpen`) park the agent only once its reply is over (its terminal item ended `streaming`, the turn is `held`, or — in a team — the daemon stopped counting the held lead in `rootsWorking`): the daemon counts them across turn boundaries, so they never decide a send mid-reply, here or in `queueMayDrainAfterReplay`. An agent blocked in its own wait on sub-agents is parked by the daemon's word, not the renderer's: claude's held turn, codex's `wait` (announced as `turn_held`), a manager's `await_agent` (`awaitingCalls`), each kept for a short gap after the wait returns so a polling agent is not read as busy between two waits.
- A send clears the composer first. `restoreUnsent` puts unsent content back into the thread it came from, never over newer typing.
- A message a turn accepted and then dropped (`unsentMessages` on a `system` row, paired by the user row's `deliveryId`) is drawn "Not sent" with Resend, quoting the CLI's `unsentReason` when it refused the message; the rules live in `chats/not-sent-messages.ts`. A `message_agent` "delivered" row whose `followUpId` a later "not delivered" row names draws nothing (`callFollowUpId`). Nothing is sent again unasked. Only a LIVE marker restores, and only into an empty composer (`restoreIntoEmpty`); a callee's message is never restored, since the composer feeds the run's lead; Resend goes through the queue with `followUpDelivery`'s kick, and a callee's message back to its own call (`callTargetOf`), never to the lead. A marker whose messages are all on screen draws nothing itself.
- Send waits for `useAttachments().reading` and for uploads (`attachBusy`). Each read and upload carries its owning thread.
- "Send now" checks the mid-turn channel of the agent the message lands in (the run's lead, `runLeadOf` over `RunDto.currentLead`), never `activeRun.agentKind` alone (it is null for team runs).
- A Send-now press POSTs `backgroundWork: 'ask'`. A message that would cancel running sub-agents (cursor, sub-agent sessions) is refused `FOLLOW_UP_CANCELS_SUBAGENTS`, which opens the confirm (`subagentCancelAsk`) with the daemon's sentence; confirming POSTs `'cancel'`, and the question goes when its message leaves the queue.
- The drain POSTs `waitForAnswer: true`. While a card a new turn would retire waits for the user, the daemon refuses it `RUN_AWAITS_ANSWER`: the message stays queued, no banner, and the answer's own turn ending fires the drain again. A Send-now press carries no such term, since pressing it is the user moving on from the card.
- Queue drag: call `preventDefault` on `dragover` first, then decide what to move. Never return early over the dragged row.
- The paperclip is an `<input type="file">`, which also works on a phone. A non-image file becomes its path. On a phone it is uploaded first (`POST /v1/chats/uploads`).
- A pasted non-image file becomes its path (`chats/paste-file-paths.ts`). Insert it with `execCommand('insertText')`. Give back a paste you cannot replace.
- A chat in a task's worktree re-creates it once on `INVALID_CWD` and resends — a message, a Retry or an Apply (`chats/task-worktree.ts`). That is the card's own chat, and any chat whose folder the card records as its `worktreePath` (an analysis of the card's thread runs there); the folder's last segment names the only card asked.

**Run status:**

- `RunStatusKind` and `RUN_STATUS_META` (`chats/run-status.tsx`) are the one vocabulary for every surface.
- `held` and `needs-input` are derived in the renderer and never stored. There is no `idle`.
- `displayRunStatus` applies a fixed rank order. Rank 6 (background work over `completed` → `held`) is withheld from `agentRunStatus`, the reading the notification rules watch.
- `BlockStatus` is never printed verbatim. Translate it through `RUN_STATUS_OF`.
- `settled-status.ts`: only a live terminal item mirrors its status onto the run row. A replay takes one reading from its last item (`reconcileFromTail`).
- A `turn_complete` stamped `insideTurn` is not terminal. Never mirror it.
- `RunStatusEvent.noTerminalItem` lets `use-chat-run.ts` end `streaming` and drain the queue.
- A settle arriving after the open run's live terminal row ends `streaming` too, without a second drain (`liveTurnEndedRef`): a stray `running` can land between the two. After-turn bookkeeping rows (`isAfterTurnBookkeeping`) do not count as the run resuming.
- A run settling is a moment, not a flag. `settleMomentOf` reads the last terminal item first and the row's `updatedAt` only as a fallback. `subagentSpokeSince` and `taskCardIsLive` use that moment. A sub-agent's own status (`subagentBlockStatus`) reads no run state at all: its rows, else the daemon's whole-conversation reading (`daemonSubagentReadings` + `applyDaemonReadings` in `durable-transcript.ts`), which is the only place a missing ending is resolved.
- A null activity means "working, nothing named". Both live rows fall back to the one `STANDING_ACTIVITY`. `WORKING_WORDS[0]` is its twin.
- Live clocks count from durable-row timestamps, never from their own mount.
- The chat live-plane key is `CHAT_LIVE_KEY` (`liveTextKey`), never the daemon's owner key `agent`. Node id is the discriminator.
- `chats/geniro-tool.ts` is the one place host tool names are matched. A composing card of an unknown kind draws nothing.
- While a turn runs there is one clock, the worked total, and no second elapsed-time readout beside it.
- A chat's open turn starts at the user's message, else at the agent's first reply, reasoning or tool call after the last ending (a stretch the CLI runs by itself; `opensOffTurnStretch`, twin of `ItemDao.openTurnStartedAt`), moved back to when the daemon saw it wake (`RunStateDto.turnStartedAt`, `withDurableChatTurn`). Its holds, ended and standing, are the daemon's (`turnHeldMs`, `turnHeldSince`); the live announce stands in only while the re-read is out.
- Turn duration uses the CLI's own figure where one exists. A thread total is the sum of its turns, never `updatedAt - createdAt`.
- A team's header clock (`clockMs`) is one formula for any number of open turns: the union of working stretches minus `pausedSpans`, the time a card waited on the user with no background shell or delegate running. Both come from the daemon's totals route (`utils/active-spans.ts`). It is re-read when the run's `awaiting`, shells-out or delegates-out flip, or a row they are folded from lands (`movesPausedSpans`). Never fold them from loaded `items`.

**Calls, instances and delegates:**

- A team run's agents come from the run's snapshot (`GET /v1/teams/runs/:runId/team`), never the library. The new-run trigger chip is the exception.
- A call waiting under its run's active-turn cap reads `queued`, never running — on its card, in the agents panel and in the shelf's Agents chip (`CallBlockEntry.queued`, folded from the executor's `queuedCall` row; its first status row ends it; off the page, run state's `RunCallState.queued`). `queued` is unsettled and is not working.
- A call continuing an earlier call's `thread` is the same instance. Both surfaces resolve chains through `resolveCallChains` and match through `callIds`.
- Never pool every instance's work into one list. Rows are filed by `callId`. Content whose call is not loaded becomes an inferred instance.
- A main conversation exists only when there is a `status` row with no `callId`. Never infer one by counting turns.
- Never time a wait from the agent's last row.
- The call-message queue is keyed by call block id, because call ids restart per pass. It retries only `CALL_MESSAGE_REFUSED`. A message row (`role === 'user'`) is never the block's summary or result.
- The prompt-cache badge threshold is a twin of the daemon's `CACHE_EXPIRED` rule, pinned by a spec.
- A call card's line, its shut band, its tasks chip and the agents panel's instance row read the callee's own thread (`callBlockActivity`, `callBlockSummary`, `callBlockTasks`), never a sub-agent's: several run at once, each with its own card.
- With no tool of its own running, or once its turn ended, a callee with sub-agents out reads the still `<member> is waiting for N sub-agents` (`callBlockSubagentsRunning`): its blocks in the window as each reads, plus the delegates the daemon says run in this conversation with no block there (`offWindowSubagents`, laid on by `applyDaemonReadings`). A shut band showing the callee's words carries it as a chip beside them. A held turn writes no row, so that card stays `running`; `waiting` needs the turn's terminal row.
- A delegate's generic title is its id tail. `resultIsOwn` is decided structurally, never by matching a CLI's prose. A `SendMessage` is not a delegation (`isAgentToolName`).
- Shells listed in the panel are the main thread's only, dropped at the item (`subagentIdOf`).

**Thread analysis** (`analysis-dialog.tsx`, `use-thread-analysis.ts`):

- A thread's analysis is never a sidebar row and never a search hit. Its home is its popup over the source (`AnalysisDialog`), where it is read, answered, applied and replaced; the Analyze button opens the popup when one exists, else the setup dialog, and marks it (tint; a dot while working or waiting on you). The popup and the setup dialog close when their thread is deleted (the analysis went with it).
- A direct link (`#chats/<id>`) or the processes panel can still open an analysis as the thread on screen; its header's "Analyzing: <source> ↗" chip (`analysisSourceOf`) is kept for exactly that way back.
- The popup and the builder's chat dock draw their conversation with the chat screen (`Chats` with `hosted`, above): every chip, label, queue and shelf a thread has, they have.
- A team's analysis setup dialog asks the daemon whether the picked agent and model share the members' vendor (`checkTeamAnalysisJudge`) and, when most members do, says a judge marks its own vendor high and offers the other agents.
- A team's analysis ("Analyze & improve…", the open team's overflow menu) uses the same two components, each given a `subject` of kind `team`: `AnalyzeThreadDialog` (plus how many latest runs to read, twin bound `MAX_ANALYSED_RUNS`) and `AnalysisDialog` (its team analysis read by `GET /v1/teams/:slug/analysis`, never the builder chat's). The menu opens the popup when one exists, else the setup dialog; both close when the builder leaves that team, and a turn of the analysis settling re-reads the team (`reloadAfterAgentEdit`), since an applied item changes the file. Every "is this an analysis" check is `isAnalysisRun` (either column). The builder's chat dock posts the same recommendations card (its agent reads the team's latest runs), applied by the chat screen's own `applyRecommendations`.

**Run waterfall** (`chats/run-waterfall*.ts(x)`, the "Where the run went" popup, opened from the agents panel's control row straight into its full view):

- Every span, its `seq` (what "Open in chat" jumps to) and the critical path come from the daemon's waterfall route; the renderer never folds them from loaded `items`.
- `blocksCaller` (`run-waterfall-geometry.ts`) is a twin of the daemon's critical-path rule in `v1/agents/utils/thread-timeline.ts`: any call not `async` holds its caller. Change one, change the other.
- The full view reads ONE state (zoom window, selected mark, focused agent); the tables count a turn's time where it overlaps the window and its money where it ended (`run-waterfall-breakdown.ts`).
- It opens as a SEQUENCE DIAGRAM (`run-waterfall-sequence.tsx` over `sequenceLayout` in `run-waterfall-sequence-layout.ts`; Calls / Lanes, `geniro.waterfall.lanes`): a column per agent, time running down, a numbered horizontal arrow per call (numbered by when it was made) from the caller's turn at that moment and a dashed one back under the same number for a call its caller waited on (`blocksCaller`). Arrows are one neutral colour (lit or failed aside); agent colours stay on the columns and bars. Turns of one agent running at once are stacked `NEST` pixels apart, and calls one agent made within `SEQUENCE_PARALLEL_MS` with no other arrow between are framed as "N at once" (`SequenceLayout.groups`). Every arrow has a row of its own at least `SEQUENCE_ROW_MIN` below the last, and an event-free stretch over `SEQUENCE_BREAK_MS` is drawn as a short break, so nothing overlaps. Pointing at or selecting a call lights the turns that answered it (`RunWaterfallTurn.callId`); a turn lights the calls it made.
- In Lanes, every call is drawn as a rounded line between its lanes (`CallLinks`, under the bars, measured off the DOM after layout): out of the caller's turn at the moment of the call, bending into the start of the turn that answered it — the daemon's `RunWaterfallTurn.callId`, overlap only for a run recorded before turns named their call — and, for a call its caller waited on (`blocksCaller`), dotted back into the caller at the moment it returned. Lines stay quiet until the pointer is over a turn or call, which lights that mark's own links (a selected call keeps its lit); the Links switch (`geniro.waterfall.callLinks`) keeps only the selected call's.
- The lanes are drawn `scale` card widths wide (`GANTT_SCALES`, 2× to start) and scroll sideways under the pinned name column; ⌘/Ctrl + wheel steps the scale around the pointer.

**Cards (agent-drawn payloads):**

- Each card kind has a twin parser (`*-payload.ts`) of the daemon's schema.
- Agent buttons (`action-chip.tsx`, `action-card.tsx`, `use-chat-actions.ts`): what is pressable is run state's `actions`, never a fold of the window. A press refused `RUN_BUSY` is retried by the hook (same seq, same `clientMessageId`) once the turn settles, never through the composer queue, which would send the text without recording the press. The shelf group sits after the stage chip, ahead of the running team chip. A team run presses through the team routes (the hook takes whichever API the open run needs; the chat route refuses a team run), and its busy refusals are asked again on `ACTION_RETRY_MS`, since its run state opens no turn. A button whose `publisher.agentLabel` is set (another team agent's) says so: `· <agent>` on the chip, `from <agent>` on the card, linking to its call's card, which it opens (`ChatActions.openCall`: the `call:<blockId>` thread flag, then a reveal, paging first when the card is off the window; the Agents chip only reveals). A stop button lists what it stops (`spec.targets`: command and pid, plus what these start by the press) on its card and in the chip's tooltip before it is pressed, and its status reads `stopped` or `already stopped` (`alreadyStopped`).
- A command action opens `CommandConfirmDialog` from the chip, the card and the overflow row alike (the confirm state lives in `useChatActions`: `press` only sets `confirming`; one dialog per surface in `ChatProviders`), showing the exact argv, one quoted token per argument, and the folder. Nothing is sent until "Run command". The card shows the command (`Runs:`) before and after the press and, once it ends, its last run's status (exit code or error) even while the button stays live — a failed or reusable command stays pressable — plus a folded `Output` with the tail (`outputTail`, drawn through `AnsiText`, fold kept per thread). Only a message press starts a turn (`pressStartsTurn`), so only it raises a surface's working flag (the builder dock's).
- `isCardEntry` (`transcript-groups.ts`) is the one predicate over card kinds. Never write a `'task-list' || …` chain.
- A new card tool also goes in `GENIRO_TOOL_NAMES`, which the compiler cannot check.
- Findings keep the agent's order.
- Charts key rows by position (`s0`, `s1`, …), never by series name. `null` stays a gap.
- Metrics colour a delta by stated sentiment, never by sign.
- The gallery loads through `LocalImageLoaderContext`. It does that sequentially and only while open, releases images on fold, and uses no lightbox of its own. A picture named by URL arrives already downloaded by the daemon (a local path, with the URL as `source`); the renderer never fetches one. Each card shows its caption and description under the picture in one horizontally scrolling strip, and the viewer shows the description too.
- Dynamic workflow: the roster is taken whole. A launch is recognised by a `workflow_info` row, never by tool name.
- `propose_patch` renders as an ordinary approval card (`diff-view.tsx` `editDiffOf`). Its tool-name literal is a twin. `save_project_instructions` does too, drawing the daemon's unified hunks and the `P-` ids it carries out (`projectInstructionsCardOf`, `UnifiedDiff`) while its hazard scan reads the whole old and new text; the verdict row's `outcome` (`not-saved` draws "✗ Not saved") and `answer` say what Apply did, for a patch too (`hostPatchVerdict`). The card marks the words that changed inside paired lines (`UnifiedDiff` `wordLevel`). Both proposals are `'patch'` in `GENIRO_TOOLS` (`isProposedChange`); a refused `save_project_instructions` call keeps its row (`transcript-groups.ts`).
- A plan or question row that cannot be parsed falls back to the permission body.
- `propose_team` draws `TeamProposalCard` from its `approval_request` row (`team-proposal-payload.ts`, twin of the daemon's `TeamProposalSchema` / `TeamDiff` / `TeamProposalOutcome`); an unreadable payload falls back to the permission body. The agent's `summary` and `reason` (a change sent as edits — a builder chat's, or an ordinary chat's to a library team — always carries both) are drawn as its own words under the title. Saved / not saved is the verdict row's `outcome`, never the agent-bound message. A card whose team half changes nothing (`diff.identical`) says so in its badge and its saved line, and offers Open project instead of Open team where the surface can open one (`onOpenProject`; the project's own chat, already on that page, cannot). Its Approve gate scans every string the card can draw, raw (`proposalScanText`), the diff's old side included. `components/stage-graph-flow.tsx`, `lazy()` behind `StageGraph`, is the only chat-reachable importer of `@xyflow/react` and `elkjs`. The card draws the members (each with its public role and the blocks addressed to it, never its private instructions), the trigger member and the stages, and — as sections of their own beside the shared team, each a `UnifiedDiff` — a bound project's overlay and a project's instructions the same Approve writes (`overlay`, `project`, each read tolerantly and dropped whole when malformed), its approval line naming every file it changes; a proposal recorded in the node-graph shape is read through `teamFromLegacyGraph`. The change list comes first and is open; the members and the stage texts start folded, a fold still showing the members and stages a replacement adds or changes (`previewMarks`, `stageMarksOf`) and saying how many more it holds; and a long changed value is drawn as its two sides, which the daemon quotes from where they differ (`quoteTextChange`). The card stands across turns, so it counts as needs-input only while no turn streams (`standsAcrossTurns`, the daemon's `awaitingOf`).
- The plan and team cards share their note field and its send rule (`chats/verdict-note.tsx`); the hazard gate is `chats/text-hazard-gate.tsx`, shared with the permission card.
- A question card is drawn from the row's `questions`, never from a CLI's tool name. `secret` masks the field.
- `useOneShotVerdict` is the one verdict-timing contract.
- Only the latest task-list card shows its rows. Fold state derived from data takes a press override (`useThreadOverride`). Never seed derived open state into `useState`.
- Approval cards scan for text hazards (`chats/text-hazards.ts`):
  - Bidi or invisible characters gate Approve until acknowledged.
  - The tick resets when the content changes. Deny is never gated.
  - The banner names codepoints and never prints the character.
  - Join scanned parts with spaces, never newlines. Ordinary emoji are exempt.

**Artifacts** (`published-artifact.ts`, `artifact-frame.tsx`):

- The frame's sandbox is the root `AGENTS.md`'s (_Constraints_, the artifact page's outbound call). The page is served by the daemon, never put in `srcdoc`, and loaded with `referrerPolicy="no-referrer"`.
- Only theme tokens and height cross the frame, by `postMessage`, filtered on `event.source`.
- Key the frame by `${artifactId}:${version}`.
- A `show_artifact` row is never claimed into a call card (`UNCLAIMABLE_KINDS`): a callee's page is drawn in the main flow, and the newest-card sweep spans the whole run.
- The panel list comes from `GET /v1/chats/:runId/artifacts` and answers empty on a run mismatch.
- A saved file bakes in the theme and restates the CSP as `ARTIFACT_FILE_CSP`, a twin of the daemon's `artifact-page.ts`. Insert them into a parsed `<head>` (`DOMParser`), never by text splice.
- A saved file must look like the framed page. The daemon's raw reading (`renderArtifactDocument`) carries the frame's base style (font, padding, box-sizing, centring) but not its transparent ground, and the export supplies the ground.
- Links are opened by the host, only for `http:`, `https:` and `mailto:` (`shared/link-schemes.ts`). Main's `guardArtifactFrameNavigations` cancels any frame navigation away from the artifact route.
- Share (`artifact-share.tsx` over `use-artifact-sharing.ts`, provided as `ArtifactShareContext` by `Chats`): beside Save on the card and in the dialog header; null on a paired phone, which draws nothing. A press sends the current `themeVars()`. The link (key in its `#fragment`) is read from the daemon when the panel opens, never kept in the list — and only for a share that was uploaded (`sharedVersion > 0`). A share waiting on sign-in (`awaiting-sign-in`) tints the icon `text-warning` and shows "Sign-in required (<cli>)" with `SignInAction` (`components/sign-in-action.tsx` over `use-share-sign-in.ts`, polling like `use-cli-login.ts` but never sharing its wire) in the panel and as a strip under the card; the daemon retries after the sign-in and announces `shares_changed`, which re-reads the list (`daemon-client.ts` `onSharesChanged`). Settings → Sharing checks a place only on Check, never on open. Settings → Sharing (`settings/sharing.tsx`) edits the places, the agents switch and the auto-revoke window, and lists every shared page with the moment it was first shared, Copy link, Revoke and Revoke all.

**Shells** (`chats/shell-activity.ts`):

- Detached state comes from the daemon's `shell_open`/`shell_info` rows, never from a text match. `readLaunchHandle` stays strict and anchored at the start of the reply.
- A failed kill is not a kill.
- Foreground commands are gated on `isSettledRunStatus`. Detached commands are not.
- The whole gate lives in `Chats.tsx`'s `shellsByAgent`, and every count flattens that map.
- `shell_info` and `workflow_info` rows are skipped outright in `groupTranscript`.

**The RING is drawn from three sources** in strict recency order (`chatContextFigures`): the live delta, then `Run.contextTokens`, then the last settled turn of the loaded transcript. `useContextReadings` is the last fallback.

- Read the live value directly, never through `agents[0]`.
- `rememberRunContext` mirrors live readings onto the run-row copy, only when the value changed and is positive.
- A team's composer ring is its lead's (`runLeadOf`: `RunDto.currentLead`, else the trigger's member). Otherwise it is null. A relay run also shows who leads as the shelf's `LeadChip`, and draws every member's rows with their identity (no `soloNodeId`).
- A member's ring order is `cardContextOf`. The nodes route is fetched on run open and reconnect only (`reconnectNonce`), and its map is cleared on entry.
- A geniro-performed compaction (cursor) invalidates earlier readings. It resets the fold (`endsContextHistory`), clears the live plane and the mirrored row, and the ring shows empty with `awaitingReading`.
- The context panel is fetched on open and never polled. On a team run every readout branch carries `memberId`.
- Category colours are assigned by position, never by name.
- Money goes through `formatUsd` (a bound, for columns), `formatExactUsd` (an exact value, for standalone figures) or, for chart ticks only, `formatUsdAxis` (`stats/stats-format.ts`). Never add another format. A figure nothing measured is a dash or omitted, never `$0.00` or `0`.

**Composer and chips:**

- `directory-select` is the one directory chip.
- `config-dir-select` renders nothing (never a disabled chip) when the CLI's `configDirs[]` row names a reason. `EffortSelect` and `ContextWindowSelect` return null on an empty listing.
- `target-select`: a CLI this machine cannot run is shown disabled, never hidden. The current target is never refused.
- `BranchSelect` switches the checkout. `BranchValueSelect` only records a name.
- The composer's model and its axes are one control (`chats/model-settings-select.tsx`), with two levels. Do not go back to a row of separate chips.
- Axes show one loading row while listings load.
- Context windows and model parameters come from the CLI per (CLI, model), never from a table here. Choosing a model clears the window everywhere it is stored (`modelChangePatch`).
- Use `withModelParameter` for parameter edits. An inline spread writes `{id: undefined}`.
- Auto-compact bounds are twinned in `shared/contracts.ts`. `Settings.lastAutoCompactPercent` is one value, not one per CLI.
- Approval modes come from `GET /v1/capabilities` `approvals[]`, never from an allowlist of agent names. `requiresPass` and `withheld` modes are hidden. The current value is always kept.
- A mid-turn mode change refused with 409 `RUN_BUSY` shows `daemonErrorDetail`.

**Pull requests and changes:**

- A thread's pull requests are only those it opened or its CLI recorded it touching (the run wire's `pullRequests`, each marked `opened`; a task card shows only the opened ones), addressed by URL (`use-thread-pull-requests.ts` over `readPullRequestsByRef`). That hook is the only source for the panel, the sidebar and the shelf.
- A pull request's recorded outcome (`record_outcome`) is the daemon's `DisplayedPullRequest.outcome`, never folded from the window: the shelf chip draws its acceptance mark beside the number from it, and a `run_outcome` transcript row reads superseded once that outcome's seq is newer than its own (`RunOutcomesContext`). The row opens on a press into the agent's summary, every figure and the pull request's link row; its title and state come from the same `use-thread-pull-requests.ts` answers the panel draws (`RunOutcomes.resolved`), so a surface that asks none draws the number alone. `daemon-client.ts` carries it through every run-status announce. The agents panel's Pull requests section draws a pull request's whole outcome history under its row (`chats/pull-request-outcome-history.tsx`, folded per thread to the newest verdict), read from the daemon (`GET /v1/chats/:runId/outcomes`, `use-run-outcomes.ts` over `use-run-daemon-read.ts`, the one whole-run read the artifacts and team-notes lists share) and re-read when the newest outcome seq on the run's list moves.
- A team run's stage progress is the daemon's `RunDto.stages` (`StageProgress`), replaced whole by every `run_status.stages` (`run-status-row.ts`) — never folded from `stage_change` rows, so `n/m` and every status hold past the loaded window. The progress popup (`progress-dialog.tsx`, opened from the shelf's Progress chip and the agents panel's Goals row; its stage rows are `stage-entry.tsx`), the agents-panel Stages section (moves through `moveTeamRunStage` with `expectedRev`; a `409 STAGE_PROGRESS_CHANGED` keeps the dialog open) and the transcript row (`stage-change-row.tsx`, next-stage titles from `RunStagesContext`, provided once with the transcript's values (`TranscriptContexts`); a move's row reads superseded once its stage's `StageProgressEntry.rev` names a later move, a nudge's once the run's `rev` moved on) all draw it, and every stage graph is the one `components/stage-graph.tsx`: React Flow nodes laid out and routed by ELK (`stage-graph-layout.ts`, orthogonal wires, so a wire that skips stages runs beside them and never across a pill), drawn once its lazy chunk and the layout land, so a spec reading its pills awaits `__tests__/settle-stage-graphs.ts`. The board card's line reads `TaskDto.stage`; `use-board.ts` reloads on a stages-only announce for a run it holds.
- A sidebar row names the thread's newest resolved pull request among those it opened, and a touched one only for a thread that opened none — never in place of an opened one that did not resolve (`rowPullRequestOf`).
- A ref GitHub could not answer still draws a row.
- The renderer replaces the run's list wholesale on each announce.
- Do not reintroduce a branch-scoped pull-request list.
- `keepFresherRows`: a pin, colour or pull-request list written without moving `updatedAt` is decided by the listing. So are the live readings (`awaiting`, `holdingFor`, the shell/sub-agent/call counts), unless an announce of them arrived while the listing was in flight: no write stamps them, and an announce's `at` always postdates the row's `updatedAt`.
- "Changed since this chat started" uses `upstreamBaseSince` and excludes what a pull brought in. The header names the ref and claims no cause.
- A folder on one of the thread's open pull requests is measured from that pull request's base branch, so a stacked branch lists what GitHub lists (`changesPullRequestsOf` → `getChangesSince`'s fourth argument, re-read when GitHub's answer lands; `folderPullRequest` in main keeps those of the `origin` repository and matches the checked-out branch, else the head commit, else, for a detached worktree, a commit behind or past that head that is not already on its base). Without a match, a fetched base ref or a base past the start, the read falls back to the default branch, then the start. A worktree's dialog section names its own ref. A read past `MAX_CHANGES` draws `N+` on the chip, and its line counts cover only the files read.
- The changes chip and dialog also count the worktrees the thread's agents made (`use-run-work-folders.ts`). A worktree is the thread's only if all three hold: main lists it (`listWorktrees(cwd, startedAtMs)`: a linked worktree made after the thread started — birth of its `.git` link file — never the main checkout and never a geniro task worktree, the direct children of `worktreesRoot()`), and the run's own tool calls name it (`POST /v1/chats/:runId/named-paths`). Each is read as a work folder (`getChangesSince(…, true)`: from where its history meets the start, past what upstream already has). Found folders are only ever added; each lists in its own dialog section. Listings go through `worktree-list.ts` (see _Git_ in `apps/ui/src/main/AGENTS.md`).

**Thread UI memory** (`chats/thread-ui-memory.ts`):

- Folds are remembered per thread, keyed by the row they belong to (`tools:<group id>`, `tool:<call id>`, …), never by an index.
- Only a press writes.
- Which hook remembers a boolean, in a thread or outside one: `.claude/rules/renderer-components.md` → _The one home for…_.
- Two things are deliberately not per thread: the context readout's drill-downs and the builder palette.
- The agents panel is always rendered when a chat is open and starts folded per thread. Nothing but its per-thread fold shows or hides it: no show/hide toggle, no header button, no auto-open on an artifact.
- The agents panel's column holds only what belongs to the thread: its agents, teams, pull requests and pages. The run waterfall, the processes readout and the notes open in popups from its control row (and rail), never as sections in the column; the waterfall's and processes' reads are gated on that popup being open (`onPopupChange`), never on the panel being unfolded.
- The progress popup (`chats/progress-dialog.tsx`: a team run's stages, the goals with the user's add, edit, close and reopen, and the thread's outcome) is the chat screen's too: the shelf's Progress chip and the agents panel's Goals row open it. The chip stands whenever the thread has stages, goals or an outcome, or the user can add a goal, and reads "Set goals" — the one status counter with words — while the user can add one and none is set; moving a stage stays in the panel's Stages section.
- The notes popup (`chats/notes-dialog.tsx`: the user's own notes, then a team run's team notes) is the chat screen's, not the panel's: the control row's notes button, the shelf's Team notes chip and a `team_note` row in the transcript (`TeamNoteOpenContext`) all open it, the last two on the pressed note.
- Read the MCP listing only when its disclosure opens (`mcpOpen`).

**Fast actions** (`chats/fast-action-bar.tsx`, `settings/fast-actions.tsx`, `Settings.fastActions`):

- An action is a name and a description, nothing else. A press appends the description to the message box. It sends nothing and touches no chip. Never add run setup to an action.
- `persistFastActions` calls `window.geniro.updateSettings` directly, not the screen's `persist`, which swallows the rejection the rollback needs.
- The editor refuses locally whatever `settingsPatchSchema` would refuse. That boundary throws on the whole patch.

**Run configurations** (`chats/run-config.ts`, `new-chat-button.tsx`, `run-config-picker.tsx`, `projects/project-run-configs.tsx`, `Settings.runConfigs`):

- Named new-chat setups. Applying one seeds the new-chat screen and switches the branch. It sends nothing.
- Never fold run configurations and fast actions together. Doing so once deleted users' saved configurations.
- Every configuration belongs to a project (`RunConfig.projectId`), and is kept on that project's page; Settings has no pane for them. One component (`RunConfigPicker`) and one key serve the project page (inline, scoped to the project, `onReorder` laid back into the whole list by `withSubsetOrder`) and the `+` menu's "New configuration…" dialog. `onApply` separates them. The `+` menu groups them by project (`groupRunConfigsByProject`, unbound last as "No project"); its "Manage configurations…" opens the composer's project, else the Projects gallery.
- The editor refuses a draft whose project is unset or no longer listed (`runConfigRefusal`); picking a project fills an empty folder with the project's.
- A configuration with no project (saved before they belonged to projects, or whose project was deleted — a delete keeps them and clears the id) is never deleted for it: the Projects screen binds one with no id to its folder's project by the daemon's rule (`useBindRunConfigsByFolder` over `GET /v1/projects/of-folder`, once per configuration per mount), and lists the rest under the gallery (`UnboundRunConfigs`) to move into a project or delete. Older builds drop a configuration carrying `projectId` (strict `runConfigSchema`).
- A team target writes none of the per-CLI choices. A `null` through those setters deletes the remembered entry.
- A branch refusal is a partial success: amber, through `composerNotice`, with no worktree redirect.
- `chats/composer-values.ts` reads foreign settings strings. Import it, never restate it.

**Session picker and config profiles:**

- The session picker searches every profile on the daemon. The fan-out is in the renderer, because profiles live in `settings.json`.
- The profile is carried on the row, and `resumeSession` takes it from the row.
- `partialReason` names unreadable profiles and a hit `SESSION_LIST_LIMIT`. There is no client-side filter. Do not reintroduce a folder-scope filter.
- The picker's agent is its own. `sessionProfiles` collapses to the default profile for a CLI with no config directory.
- A `ConfigProfile` is `{ id, name, agent, dir, color }`, and the directory is its identity. Two entries may not name one directory.
- A profile is offered to its own CLI only.
- The palette union is spelled in `shared/contracts.ts` (not derived from `RunGroupColor`). `GROUP_DOT_CLASS` stays an exhaustive `Record`.

**Looks redundant, is not.** Check here before cutting:

- The task list renders in both the transcript and the agents panel. The user confirmed they want both.
- The shelf's Tasks, Sub-agents and Terminals chips restate panel counts on purpose.
- The chat-list row is four lines. Do not delete one.
- The tail `ResizeObserver` watches the scroller itself as well as its children, because a shrinking viewport fires nothing else.
- The composer shelf reserves its height (`min-h-7`). Anything thread-produced worth reaching is another chip there, never a new band. Content chips (changes, pull requests, buttons, teams) run durable to volatile from the left; the status counters (Terminals, Monitors, Sub-agents, Agents, Team notes, Tasks, Progress) are glyph + figure only in `ComposerShelf`'s right-anchored `status` cluster, volatile to durable so the right edge stays put.

**Do not reintroduce:**

- Landing-view centring on the window.
- The run's folder in the composer: it belongs in the header.
- A horizontal timeline strip, or a timeline inside `subagent-block.tsx`.
- Always-visible controls for an absent axis.

### Teams

- "Team" is the thing; the noun rule is in the root `AGENTS.md`. The renderer screen is `teams/`, never a canvas: `Teams.tsx` holds the state (load, autosave, chat dock, dialogs) and draws `teams-library.tsx` (cards with a portrait of members, `team-card.tsx`) or `team-page.tsx` (header, `team-hero.tsx`, Team / Memory / Statistics tabs over `components/tab-strip.tsx`). The Team tab is Members (`member-card.tsx`, opening `member-sheet.tsx` beside the page — name, avatar, character, role, instructions, the agent settings, MCP, pool and removal; full screen on a phone; the last member cannot be removed), Stages (the mode, `stage-journey.tsx` led by its `EntryCard` — the trigger's member, required — and `stages-dialog.tsx`) and Team instructions (`instructions-card.tsx`: blocks with an audience through `member-pick.tsx` `AudiencePick`). Every reading is the daemon's: the hero's figures, the Statistics tab (its **How each member works** table included) and the member sheet's **Performance** group (`member-performance.tsx`: the member's figures and their spread per run, every change that touched it with the effect the daemon measured, and every analysis's marks of it, newest first, with the judge and the user's own verdict — `components/assessment-verdict.tsx`, also on each member row of the recommendations card through `MemberVerdictsContext`; marks and verdicts drawn by `components/member-marks.tsx` everywhere) are `GET /v1/stats/teams/:slug` (`use-team-stats.ts`), the Memory tab lists the team's entries (`use-team-memories.ts`, scope `team`), and the warning pill, status dots and the member sheet's pinned problems merge the editor's own refusals with `GET /v1/teams/:slug/health` (`use-team-health.ts`, read again after every save) and Electron main's sign-in reading (`use-sign-in-health.ts`, `detectClis({maxAgeMs})`, never a probe per page open; asked afresh after a sign-in settles). Only the open team's page asks `probe=true` (it lists each profile's MCP servers once, which starts the user's stdio servers, and re-reads while a member's `checking` is set). The library's **⚠ N** is the daemon's cheap reading (`probe=false`, at most four teams at once) plus each member seat's sign-in from the same cached `detectClis({maxAgeMs})` (`MemberHealth.seats`), labelled with the age of the MCP reading; it does not count the editor's refusals, which need the team open. Deleting a team asks what happens to its memories when it keeps any (`team-memory-fate.tsx`, `DELETE /v1/teams/:slug?memories=forget|keep|global`). A fix button per problem kind is `use-member-fixes.tsx`; only a red problem stops a run (the daemon's `TEAM_NOT_READY`).
- The page's **⚠ N need setup** pill (`warning-pill.tsx`) lists distinct problems, not member findings: `groupMemberFindings` (`team-problems.ts`) folds a finding about one CLI account (agent + profile) into one row naming every member it reaches, MCP servers counted and listed on request (`details`), with one fix — so a profile's servers across five members are one row, not a row per server per member. Errors come first.
- A member card's setup problems are one **!** badge in its corner (`member-card.tsx`, a `HoverPopover` listing each problem with its fix). A member's face is `components/member-avatar.tsx` (`MemberAvatar`, `AvatarStack`), everywhere: picture, emoji or initials on `bg-avatar-*`, falling back to initials when a picture cannot be read. A picture is uploaded by `components/avatar-picker.tsx` (square-cropped on a canvas, PNG) to `POST /v1/teams/avatars` and read back as a `data:` URI through `AvatarImageLoaderContext` (provided by `App`), since the CSP allows no other image source. Transcript identity reads the run's snapshot (`TranscriptNodeMeta.avatar`), never the library, and never shows the character.
- The team document's edits are pure functions in `teams/team-doc.ts` (`withMember`, `withoutMember`, `withTriggerMember`, `teamFromMeta`). Removing a member also drops it from every block audience and stage `responsible` list, and hands the trigger to the first member left. A new team starts with one member that handles the first message, so it saves at once.
- `teams/team-validate.ts` (twin of the daemon's `validateTeam`), `member-validate.ts` (field limits and NUL rules, twin of `teams.types.ts`) and `stage-validate.ts` (twin of `validateStages`) mirror every daemon refusal; while any refusal stands, autosave holds and the status bar names it, since one refused field would stop every later save. A warning (an audience or `responsible` id naming no member) never holds a save.
- Member and block derivations over the generated types live in `teams/member-schema.ts` (`runsUnasked`, `audienceOf`, `audienceReaches`, `modelChangePatch`); `audienceOf` exists because the generator renders the audience union as an empty interface.
- **Versions…** (the open team's overflow menu, only with a saved team): `teams/team-versions-dialog.tsx` over `use-team-versions.ts`, read only while open and again after `usage_recorded`. Every figure is the daemon's (`GET /v1/stats/team-versions`); the dialog never folds or sums one. It is a summary strip (runs, versions, average cost per run) over one card per version, newest first, not sortable: `#n` and hash with its badges, dates used and runs, average cost per run, and `DiffFigures` (`+N −M`); one layout on desktop and phone. An unmeasured figure or a missing diff says why as visible text, never hover-only. A press on a numbered version replaces the list with that version's `git diff` against the one numbered before it (`chats/diff-view.tsx` `UnifiedDiff`); there are no expanding rows and no run list (user decision). That view also restores the version (`ConfirmActionButton`, never for the current one): the Teams screen flushes autosave, posts the restore quoting `loadedHashRef`, then re-opens the team from disk (`openTeam`) and names the backup in the status bar; a version recorded before members is labelled "before teams"; a `TEAM_CHANGED` refusal raises the stale-copy banner. It is held back, with the reason shown, while the builder chat's agent works or the editor's copy is stale. The `current` mark is the library team's; a team not run since its last edit is its own first card ("New version", "not run yet"), and it opens to its diff but offers no restore.
- Library and member cards take activation from `NavListItem`. Never use a `div role="button"` with a nested delete or fix button. A library card counts members and stages, never nodes or edges.
- `Teams.openRequest` (a chat card's "Open team") leaves an open team the way Back does: flushed first, and the "Leave without saving?" prompt when that fails, opening the request on Discard.
- Never pair `line-clamp-*` with a `display` utility.
- A block runs nothing and has no `node_state`.
- Member fields that reach argv, and a stage's text, refuse NUL only, because the same schema reads saved YAML.
- Switching a member's CLI starts from that CLI's defaults; the editor remembers the last CLI picked for a new member (`rememberMemberAgent`).
- `useAgentVocabulary` resolves during render off its cache, never from effect-set state.
- Free-text model mode waits for a non-empty list.
- There is no model adopt and no effort adopt, because unset is a real answer.
- The member sheet uses the composer's chips, never builder-only copies. Approval modes come from `approvals[]` with `plan` filtered out.
- The builder's MCP read is not gated on a press: its 4xx is the only signal of a bad config path.
- A member's MCP switches are its own `mcpDisabled` and write nothing the CLI keeps.
  - A switched-off name the profile does not list shows as an `off` row.
  - Switching CLI clears the list.
  - Pool members fetch under their own CLI and profile.
- Instruction sizes (`useInstructionSizes`) are measured while the Team tab or a selected member is on view, never on the Memory or Statistics tab with no one selected. The Team tab draws each block's own size on its card (`InstructionSizesWire.blocks`: its trimmed text and how many members carry it) and every member's total under the blocks (`team-instruction-sizes.tsx`); the member sheet keeps that member's breakdown.

- **Project overrides** live on the project's page, never the team's (user decision): the team page shows only **Used by** (`team-used-by.tsx`, the projects whose default it is, each opening its page) and, in the delete confirm, whose overrides go with it. The project page's Team section (`projects/project-team-overrides.tsx` over `use-team-overlay.ts` and `team-overlay-doc.ts` — twin of the daemon's `applyTeamOverlay` for the Model group) draws the team as that project runs it and writes only the overlay, autosaved quoting its hash (`TEAM_OVERLAY_CHANGED` keeps the edits and offers Reload): member cards with their override badges, the member sheet in project mode (name and avatar a `fieldset disabled`, the team's character, role and instructions as `ReadOnlyText`, Model rows `MemberModelGroup` — shared with the team page — with `scopeOf`, i.e. `OverridableRow`s whose controls stay live: changing one overrides it for the project, which marks the row with an accent edge, the project's name and a reset back to the team's value, a quiet Team tag otherwise; the pool the same way, overridden whole by its first change; extra instructions), and no copy of the team's instruction blocks: **Manage team** opens the team's page. **Team blocks only in <project>** (`project-scope-instructions.tsx`) adds, edits and removes the overlay's own blocks, each with an audience; it is not a twin of the project's instructions, which reach every member and name no audience (user decision). Stages are the team's and take no project addendum (user decision), and the sheet in project mode has no Tools & MCP group (MCP switches are the team's) and ends in **Restore team settings** (`withTeamSettings`: every Model setting and the pool back to the team's, the extra instructions kept; behind a confirm). An overlay's `allMembers` (one default per CLI) has no editor (user decision: the panel was unclear); the project's chat sets it, and every reading applies it. The sheet is portalled into the page's side slot (`project-page-slots.ts`).
- **The project's chat** is opened from **Change with chat** in the project page's hero (`project-detail.tsx`), for a project whatever its default, and docked into the page's bottom slot (`ProjectChatPanel` over `chats/hosted-chat-dock.tsx`, the dock `TeamChatPanel` uses too). It is one chat per project (`POST|DELETE /v1/projects/:projectId/chat`), proposes the project's instruction blocks and its default team's overlay on cards, and never the shared team: the team's builder chat (`TeamChatPanel`) is opened from the team's page only and bound to no project. Before every send the page writes what is typed and not yet saved (the instructions form's and the overlay's `flushRef`); while a turn works the overlay is not autosaved (`chatWorking`); after each turn the page re-reads the project list and the Team section reads the team and overlay back (`reloadKey`).

**What the builder must never lose** (pinned in `Teams.spec.tsx`):

- Closing the chat dock hides it and never unmounts it. Autosave is paused while the agent works. The dock's turn ending starts the builder's re-read, and the next send waits for it before writing the editor (`reloadAfterChatTurn`, `beforeChatSend`): a queued message leaves as the turn before it ends. A send no turn ended ahead of re-reads nothing, so a file changed elsewhere still meets `TEAM_CHANGED`.
- The post-turn re-read compares against the last load or save (`teamSnapshot`), never against the editor.
- Leaving waits for `flush`. A late save or re-read answer for another team is dropped.
- Every save quotes the `hash` the team was loaded or last saved at. A `TEAM_CHANGED` refusal (an analysis changed the file) holds autosave and offers Reload, which replaces the unsaved edits; nothing is written over the newer file.
- `RunDto.awaiting` follows the three-state rule: absent asserts nothing, and `null` clears.
- Every save writes `normalizedTeam` (`team-doc.ts`): `maxActiveTurns` and the description ride it like every other field, and an empty stage list is written as ABSENT, never `[]`; a save that dropped a field would lose it or loop autosave.
- `maxActiveTurns` is the "Edit team" dialog's agents-at-once row: a switch (off is no limit of its own, the machine ceiling) and a `Stepper` from 1 to the ceiling, so no value outside the range can be entered.
- `stages` (the team's stage graph) is drawn as `StageJourney` on the Team tab and edited in `stages-dialog.tsx`, whose "Responsible" pick is ordered (`ResponsiblePick`; the first member leads). A stage whose `responsible` names a removed member is a warning, never a refusal. Edit stages, a stage card and Add stage open the dialog, saved by autosave. With no stages the section is one dashed row — the first-message member and who runs every job — and the lead mode (One lead / Relay) is shown only once there are stages (or the team is already in relay). The whole team, stages included, is changed by talking through the header's one **Change with chat**; the builder agent edits stages through its ordinary `propose_team` card, which draws the proposed stages and lists each stage change by id (`TeamDiff` `addedStages` / `removedStages` / `changedStages`; a reorder alone is the `stages` team field). `components/stage-graph.tsx` (React Flow + ELK) stays the chat surfaces' stage graph only.
- Agent pools are capped at the twin `MAX_AGENT_POOL_EXTRA_MEMBERS`. Call instances name their pool member (`CallBlockEntry.member`). Hand-offs above the page arrive as anchors. A hand-off row is a card row like any other: drawn where it happened when the card's read pages reach it, else as one note under the pager (`CallBlockEntry.poolHandOff`). Never route it out of the card by `anchorIds`: a team run's call rows all reach the fold as anchors (`structure`).

### Settings

**Settings keys (`settings.json`).** `main/settings.ts` owns the file, and `shared/contracts.ts` holds `Settings`. Values whose vocabulary is the daemon's stay opaque strings here. The renderer validates them against the generated enum. `interface Settings` in `shared/contracts.ts` is the authoritative key list; this list covers the keys with special rules.

- `settingsVersion`: the last settings migration the file was brought up to (`main/settings-migrations.ts`), 0 for a file that predates it; a file written by a newer build keeps its higher number. Main's alone: `settingsPatchSchema` does not carry it, and `readSettings` reads it outside the salvage loop. A key rename or reshape is a step in `SETTINGS_MIGRATIONS`, applied to the raw JSON at launch before the first `readSettings` (the salvage drops a key this build does not know), after copying the file to `<userData>/backups/<id>-<ISO>/`. A step that throws leaves the file and its version as they were (the launch logs the failure), `readSettings` reads it with the steps before the failed one applied in memory (`withPendingMigrations`), and while the file is below the current version a write replaces only the keys it changes (`unmigratedFile`), so the next launch can retry; a step therefore leaves a key already in the new shape alone and never overwrites a target key already present.
- Composer memory: `lastChatTarget`, `lastApprovalMode`, `lastAutoCompactPercent`, `projectFolder`/`recentFolders`. The setup last used in a chat that improves something — a thread's or team's analysis, a team's or project's chat (`chats/improvement-chat-setup.ts`): `lastAnalysisConfig` (agent, profile, model, effort, context window, auto-compact, model parameters, approval), written when the analysis dialog starts one and when `HostedThread.onRunSettingsChanged` reports a chip change in the chat; a key a choice saved earlier lacks reads as unset. Its `approval` is the analysis's alone (null reads as auto-approve, never the composer's mode, and `plan` is never recorded); a team's or project's chat keeps its own in `lastChangeChatApproval` (null reads as `acceptEdits`), so an analysis's auto-approve never reaches a chat whose changes wait on the user's press. Such a chat has no agent picker, so its agent is the one remembered, unless a new team's first chat was given one (then the setup applies only if it is that CLI's); a setup the daemon refuses opens it on defaults, since nothing else there could correct it. The memory import's Sort with AI last choice: `lastMemoryTriage` (agent, profile, model, effort, context window, model parameters). `lastModels`, `lastEfforts`, `lastContextWindows`, `lastModelParameters` (`{parameterId: value}`), `configDirs` and `recentConfigDirs` are keyed per CLI.
- Hand-managed lists, three different features: `fastActions`, `runConfigs` and `configProfiles`. Never fold any two together, or into `recentConfigDirs`.
  - Nothing adds or evicts an entry, and order is preserved.
  - `readSettings` salvages each list entry by entry (`salvageList`, twin of `salvageCliRecord`) and re-applies the cap.
- `agentOptions`: `{<cli>: {<optionId>: on}}`, from capabilities `options[]`. It is snapshotted onto the run.
- `notificationsEnabled`: one switch for every notification kind.
- `archiveRetentionDays`: `null` by default. It arms a permanent deletion sweep (`POST /v1/chats/sweep-archived`), and the daemon learns the window from the client.
- `customInstructions`: see below.
- `replyLanguage`: the language every agent is told to reply in (`''` = not set), at most 64 characters (twin of the daemon's `REPLY_LANGUAGE_MAX_LENGTH`). Sent at every run start beside `customInstructions`.
- `theme`: read by main before any window exists, and enumerated in `settingsPatchSchema`. An unknown value falls back to `'system'`.
- `historyPageSize`, `checkForUpdates`, `remoteAccessEnabled`, `daemonInspect`, `cliPaths`.
- `keptSessionIdleMinutes`: how long a run's CLI and its MCP servers are kept after the last turn, 5–180, default 60 (a subscription's prompt-cache TTL), the same for chats and cards. The same window ends what the run's agents left running outside the CLI that attribution can reach (dev servers, watchers; not an orphaned system binary), with a note in the transcript (`apps/daemon/AGENTS.md` → Run processes → Idle). The bounds are twins of the daemon's (`chat.types.ts`). Every write that changes it is pushed to the daemon (`kept-session-config-push.ts`, through `onSettingsWritten`), as is every daemon start; the daemon holds it in memory.
- `preventSleepWhileWorking`: on by default. While on, main holds `powerSaveBlocker` `prevent-app-suspension` exactly while the daemon answers `GET /v1/agents/activity` `working` (`main/keep-awake.ts`); it never holds the display, and a closed lid still sleeps. Read at launch and applied on every write (`onSettingsWritten`).
- `sharing`: `{destinations, defaultDestinationId, agentsMayShare, autoRevokeAfterDays}` — where pages are shared to, whether agents may share (off by default), and after how many days the daemon revokes a page on its own (`null`, never, by default; counted from the first share). A custom (`command`) destination may carry `signIn: {login?, patterns?}` (login argv, and output phrases meaning signed out). Salvaged destination by destination (`salvageSharing`), and a broken `signIn` field by field, never costing the destination; the shape is a twin of the daemon's `ShareDestinationSchema` (`ipc-schemas.ts` restates its limits). Every write that changes it is pushed to the daemon (`share-config-push.ts` over `daemon-config-push.ts`, through `onSettingsWritten`), as is every daemon start. Desktop only.
- `knowledge`: `{enabled, agentWrites}` — whether agents get the knowledge index and tools (on by default), and whether an agent's write waits for review (`review`, default), is saved at once (`direct`) or refused (`off`, `knowledge_save` unlisted). Pushed by `knowledge-config-push.ts`; a paired device may write it.
- `memory`: `{enabled, agentWrites, nativeMemoryOff}` — whether agents get the shared memory's tools (on by default), whether an agent's write is saved at once (`active`, default) or waits for the user's review (`pending`, under which agents can only add entries — their updates and forgets are refused), and whether new runs switch each CLI's own memory off (off by default; a successful import in Settings → Memory turns it on). Salvaged field by field (`salvageMemory`); the shape is a twin of the daemon's `MemoryConfigSchema`. Every write that changes it is pushed to the daemon (`memory-config-push.ts`, through `onSettingsWritten`), as is every daemon start; the daemon holds it in memory and uses the defaults until the first push. Writable from a paired device (the user reads and edits memory from the phone).

**Settings → Storage** (`settings/storage.tsx`): the daemon's groups (`GET /v1/storage`) plus main's share (`getAppStorage` over the daemon's `unclaimed` names). A clean-up is the daemon's background job: the page posts it on the confirming press and, while it runs, polls `GET /v1/storage/job` (never the measuring `GET /v1/storage`) one request at a time, `STORAGE_JOB_POLL_MS` after each answer, then measures once. Compact is the exception: the daemon only schedules it, and the page then restarts the daemon (`restartDaemon`), which compacts before it serves anything; the outcome is read from the restarted daemon's `job`. Hidden on a paired phone.

**Knowledge (`knowledge/`, `#/knowledge[/<id>]`):** the list over every place (`Knowledge.tsx`, `knowledge-row.tsx`), one document (`knowledge-document-view.tsx`) with its history (`knowledge-history.tsx`), the form (`knowledge-form.tsx`, `MdEditor` opened on `preview='edit'` with `highlight={false}`, since a live preview or syntax colouring redoes 256 KB on every key), and the review of what agents propose (`knowledge-review.tsx`, drawn with `UnifiedDiff` over the daemon's `diff`). Lists are the daemon's and body-free, re-read on `knowledge_changed` (`daemon-client.ts` `onKnowledgeChanged`). A `409 KNOWLEDGE_STALE` keeps the typed text and offers Reload; a stale proposal offers its text, never Approve. An unreviewed `active` document and any whole text under review are drawn raw (`knowledge-raw-text.tsx`), because rendered Markdown drops comments and unused link references. The transcript's tool row re-reads its documents in the run's own places when it opens (`KnowledgeLoaderContext`, `listKnowledge({handle, runId})`), so it shows what they are now; a search whose result came back with no text, as cursor-agent reports a successful MCP result, asks `GET /v1/knowledge/runs/:runId/search`, the same search the agent's tool runs. The rail's count and the project page's section read `GET /v1/knowledge/counts`. Markdown export goes through `saveKnowledgeExport`, refused on a paired device.

**Settings → Memory** (`settings/memory.tsx`, entries drawn by `components/memory-row.tsx`, edited in `memory-form.tsx`, imported through `memory-import-dialog.tsx`):

- Every list is the daemon's (`GET /v1/memories`, paged by its cursor), re-read on `memory_changed` (`daemon-client.ts` `onMemoryChanged`); the pane never folds or edits its copy in place. The waiting-for-review list is its own read (`status: pending`), shown beside the active-and-waiting filter only; past its cap it leads to the pending filter.
- A transcript memory row (`chats/memory-tool-row.tsx`) opens a `HoverPopover` over the entries its call named (search hits, read handles, a save's handle or the near-duplicates it was refused for, a forget's handle), each read fresh from the daemon by handle on open through `MemoryLoaderContext` (provided by `ChatProviders`, so the chat, call cards, the sub-agent dialog and every hosted chat read alike). A press never leaves the chat; only a panel entry's "Open in Settings → Memory" opens the pane on that one entry (`handle` query, every status), and the shell holds the focus (`App` → `Settings` `memoryFocus`) until "Show all".
- An agent's entry not yet approved — pending, or active but saved before review was on — offers Approve; only approved, user and imported entries reach the memory index.
- The import is sent in batches of the daemon's row cap; it sends every CLI profile settings.json names and every library team's agent and pool member runs on (`importProfiles`: `configDirs`, `recentConfigDirs`, `configProfiles`, then the nodes' `configDir`, per CLI kind, never a CLI's name; read fresh when the dialog opens) and only preview keys plus the type and scope chosen; the daemon reads which CLIs keep memory and re-reads the text. An import that brought notes in turns `nativeMemoryOff` on over the settings as they stand then, and its note says so, also after a later batch failed. Import and export are hidden on a paired phone (the import is desktop only on the daemon too); edit, forget, restore, approve and Forget all are not.
- The import dialog groups rows by `agentKind` + `profile` + `folder` (the daemon's display paths), pages them (`IMPORT_PAGE_SIZE`), and filters and searches over every row, never the page; Tick shown, a group's tick and the filters' counts reach every matching row. A row is ticked by the user's own press first, else by its default (new, similar to nothing, importable) and, once the AI sort judged it, only if it was kept.
- **Sort with AI** (`settings/use-memory-triage.ts`) sends the default-ticked rows not judged yet to `POST /v1/memories/import/triage` in batches of `TRIAGE_BATCH` (twin of the daemon's cap), a few at a time, stops on the first failure, and keeps its verdicts by note key in the pane, so reopening the dialog neither loses nor re-asks them. Offered only for the CLIs the preview names (`triageAgents`); never on a paired phone, where import is hidden. Beside its button the user picks the agent and, through the composer's own `ModelSettingsSelect` (`settings/memory-triage-settings.tsx`), everything a chat runs with but approval and auto-compact (a one-off answer has neither); the pick is saved as `lastMemoryTriage` on every change and the next dialog opens on it, and switching agent starts its settings blank.
- A near-duplicate refusal offers saving again past exactly the handles it named (`nearDuplicateHandles`).

Data-loss rules:

- Removing or renaming a key destroys what it held. `readSettings` keeps only known keys, and `writeSettings` rewrites the whole file. Migrate (`settings-migrations.ts`) or export first.
- An unparseable file is copied aside to `settings.json.corrupt-<timestamp>` (0600) before any write. A file that cannot be read is never overwritten.
- Two clean breaks are on record: `agentOptions`, and question cards' `questions`. The next break migrates or exports first.

Sign-in:

- `use-cli-login.ts` is the one controller for an agent CLI's sign-in (a share destination's is `use-share-sign-in.ts`, kept apart from that wire on purpose), and `components/cli-login-progress.tsx` is the one panel for both. Signing in never opens a terminal.
- `CliLoginController.starting` is set synchronously before the await and cleared in `finally`.
- Sign-in buttons are disabled while starting, because a second press invalidates the first challenge.
- The flag belongs to the caller. `Chats` holds one controller for both flows.
- A server sign-in settles when the daemon sees it connect (`verifying`). The renderer never polls the listing itself.

Agents and MCP:

- An agent-specific setting lives in that agent's card (`AgentConfigListProps.agentSettings`), passed in by the caller. Onboarding passes none.
- Agent options are drawn from capabilities `options[]`. No card names a CLI's switch.
- MCP Add and Edit JSON write at user scope to the listing's profile. They never write to a folder or to a node's `mcpDisabled`.
- A JSON save carries the version it was read at. Read through a ref to the actions, because callers bind them inline.
- Plugin servers are `plugins[]` beside the server rows, never rows themselves.

Custom instructions:

- `customInstructions` saves through `use-debounced-persist.ts`. An unsavable value (control characters) is held on screen and never written. The timer handle is nulled.
- **Remove from existing chats** (`POST /v1/chats/forget-custom-instructions`) is an explicit press, never a side effect of clearing the box. It does not touch the snapshotted reply language.
- `replyLanguage` saves through the same debounced persist; a value over the bound or with control characters is held on screen and never written.
- The Settings screen reads the preamble and the per-CLI notes from `GET /v1/capabilities` (`hostPreamble`, `backgroundWorkNotes`), and the member sheet reads each member's block sizes from `POST /v1/teams/instruction-sizes` (measured through the same parts); never restate either in the renderer.
- The host-preamble preview renders nothing until `hostPreamble` arrives.
- Every settings write is announced to every window (`onSettingsChanged`, `main/settings-changed-notify.ts`; no payload, a no-op on the phone bridge). The member sheet re-measures its instruction sizes on it, so an edit from the Settings screen or a paired phone reaches the figures.

Appearance:

- The picker does `persist({ theme })` plus `setThemePreference`.
- `theme` gets no `??` default: `readSettings` always merges defaults.

### System notifications

**System notifications** — the renderer decides when (`renderer/notifications/run-notifications.ts`, mounted from `Chats`), and `main/notifications/` decides whether and posts.

- The rules read display statuses, never the daemon's row.
- `notificationsEnabled` is read at the moment of posting.
- A run seen for the first time never notifies.
- A cancelled turn is not announced. A `failed` turn is.
- The open chat is skipped only while the window has focus and the Chats view is on screen.
- `notifier.ts` is the only file that touches a notification API. It uses Electron's `Notification`, never `node-notifier`.
- A turn ending with a command still running is announced provisionally and withdrawn (`retractNotification`) if the run goes back to work. Never guess with a timer.
- `notify_user` arrives as `RunStatusEvent.notify` and is posted once (`AgentNotice` id).
- `share-sign-in` is posted once per agent share that starts waiting on the user's sign-in (`shares_changed` with `signInRequested`, `useShareSignInNotifications`), never for the user's own press and never carrying the link.
- An open thread's ending is held (`settleOwed`) until its settle arrives, then posted or dropped by that settle's own flag.
- The rules read `runs + offScopeRuns`, because "absent" reads as deleted.

### Sidebar

- The unread mark is the daemon's: `attentionAt` later than `seenAt`. Both timestamps only move forward. Never compute it per window.
- Report "seen" only while the thread is actually watched (`useWindowWatched`).
- What a thread waits on the user for (`chats/waiting.ts`: asking > failed > unread > working, longest wait first) is read from the unfocused status and `useUnseenRuns`. It drives ⌘J, the title-bar count, board-card marks and the agents panel's card order, and never the sidebar order: a waiting thread does not move itself (user decision). ⌘J continues from the reading it last opened, because opening an unread thread drops it from the queue.
- Drafts, the queue and turn-end banners stay per device.
- Archive is the row action. Permanent delete exists only inside the archive. Team rows archive too.
- `refreshRuns` drops a stale generation, and runs one listing per scope at a time plus one queued; only a scope switch supersedes one in flight.
- The archive and `Show all` are paged (`chats/run-list-pages.ts`, `RUN_LIST_PAGE` rows per half, `limit` + `before*` cursor); the desk is never paged. A re-list keeps the depth already read. Rows one half has but the other has not reached yet are held back (`horizonOf`), and the list ends in "Load older chats".
- An unknown run is adopted by fetching that one row (`runId` on both listings), never by re-listing, and only on an announce of it doing something (a status or an activity). A pull-request, title or context announce never adopts.
- `placeRun` re-files a row on archive or unarchive, and `dropRun` is for permanent delete only.
- Row actions read `run.archivedAt`, never the scope.
- A scope switch keeps the open thread only if the new scope lists it.
- An archived chat is inert (`RUN_ARCHIVED`). Archiving a running chat asks first, because it cancels the turn.
- Groups: the auto-file rule matches the longest `autoCwd`, segment-wise, and a team claim outranks any folder claim. Adding a rule does not sweep existing chats.
- Deleting a group releases its chats (asked first).
- Dragging reorders; the daemon is told once, at `dragend`. The drop zone is the whole section. A drop that changes nothing writes nothing.
- A group header's state comes from its rows' badges, never from the daemon `status` column. `needsInput` is reported alongside `busy`.
- The sidebar row is one activatable element, so nothing inside it may be a control (labels, not chips).
- A team row previews its root conversation (`previewsThread`, twin of `ItemDao`'s `NOT_IN_A_CALL`).
- A background thread's preview comes from the `run_status` announce, not from items.
