/**
 * Ask one CLI whether it is signed in, through its own descriptor's probe
 * (`agents/`). `null` on anything that is not a clear answer — no probe for
 * this kind, a command that could not run, unparseable output. Never guess
 * `false`: the readiness chip would tell a signed-in user to sign in.
 *
 * A non-zero exit is handed to the reader rather than read as signed-out here:
 * whether a CLI's non-zero exit is an ANSWER is a fact about that CLI. codex
 * answers "signed out" by exiting 1, and claude 2.1.280 exits 1 for a
 * signed-out profile with the same well-formed `{"loggedIn": false, …}` body it
 * exits 0 with when signed in (2.1.227 exited 0 for both) — so discarding the
 * output of a failed exit would turn every signed-out account into UNKNOWN, and
 * the card would offer nothing to fix it. A throw that carries no readable body
 * (a timeout, a missing binary) is still `null`.
 *
 * THE DAEMON HAS ITS OWN HOME for this CLI's auth facts — `AdapterConfig.auth`
 * in its adapter. This side exists because `detectClis` runs over IPC during
 * onboarding, before any daemon.
 *
 * `configDir` points the probe at one named configuration; omitted, the CLI
 * answers for its own default profile.
