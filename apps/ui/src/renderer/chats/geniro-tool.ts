 * (call_started/call_result/call_question/call_answer/await_collected)
 * already tell that story in a readable form — the raw envelope JSON rows
 * are pure duplication, so they are hidden from the transcript. Every host tool
 * rides it for the same reason: each draws its own card — a findings table, a
 * chart, a scorecard, a decision table, a diff with Apply, a plan with Approve
 * — and the raw call beside it is the same row twice.
 */

 * It is the union `isCardEntry` already ranges over, minus the kinds no tool

 * hide. `get_task`, `update_task` and `notify_user` draw nothing of their own
 * (the board tools change a card on another screen; `notify_user` posts a
 * system banner), so hiding their rows left no trace at all. REPORTED as "you
 * should have used the tool, but I don't see that tool call in the chat at all"
 * — over a turn that had moved its card to Done through `update_task`, with
 * the call and its result both in the transcript, and nothing on screen
 * between the user's message and the answer.
 *
 * `monitor`, `stop_monitor` and `list_monitors` are deliberately absent: any key
 * here hides a tool's raw rows, and a monitor call has no card, so its call
 * renders as an ordinary tool row.
 *
 * The VALUE is the card that tool draws, or null for one whose story is told by
 * the dedicated call kinds instead. Keeping both facts in one table is what
 * stops the hide list and the loader's list from drifting: a drawing tool added
 * to one is added to the other by construction.

 * belongs here; one that draws nothing does not.
