 * argument that long lines are tiring to return from. Measured against the
 * running app, what it actually produced was a paragraph column ending around
 * 530px inside an 1150px pane — REPORTED as "still have current thread with
 * big gap from right side. Content should take all space", with the composer
 * directly beneath it spanning the full width and the bubble around it doing
 * the same. In a chat transcript the cap has no ground to stand on: the pane
 * is already narrowed by the chat list on one side and the agents panel on the
 * other, the bubble's own padding insets it further, and the user resizes
 * those columns to decide how wide the reading column should be. A second,
 * invisible cap inside them only ever contradicts that choice.
 *
 * So the elements below carry spacing and type alone. `pre`/`table` were never
 * capped and still are not; they scroll inside their own containers.
 *
 * Token-styled markdown renderers — the compact mirror of geniro web's
 * MarkdownContent (react-markdown + remark-gfm), trimmed to what the
 * transcript needs: paragraphs, emphasis, lists, code, links, tables,
 * quotes, headings. Colours come from the design tokens only.
