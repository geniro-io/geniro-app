/**
 * One image an agent referenced from its own markdown.
 *
 * The reported defect was "i dont see images", and the reason was two
 * independent walls. The renderer's CSP is `img-src 'self' data:`, so a
 * `file:` source is refused outright; and a bare relative reference —
 * `![](a.png)`, one of the two forms measured in the author's own history —
 * resolves against the app's own origin, which has nothing to do with the
 * folder the agent was working in. Both are answered the same way the pasted
 * attachments already are: fetch the bytes over the token-gated daemon route
 * and hand the tag a `data:` URL.
 *
 * A failure shows the REFERENCE, not a broken-image box. "geniro could not read
 * /tmp/shots/x.png" is a fact the user can act on; a grey placeholder is the
 * bug being reported again.
