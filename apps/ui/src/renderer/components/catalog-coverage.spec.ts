/**
 * Every shared component is in the catalog, and every catalog entry is a
 * component.
 *
 * The design system's second hard rule — never duplicate a component, reuse the
 * primitive — had no mechanical check at all: the colour half is an eslint
 * override, and this half was review-only. A rule enforced by review alone is
 * enforced on the days someone remembers, and the failure is silent, because a
 * component nobody can SEE is a component the next person re-implements.
 *
 * What it enforces is DISCOVERABILITY, not de-duplication: no spec can tell
 * that two components do the same thing, only that both are in the catalog.
 *
 * The signal is the extension, which is exact here rather than a heuristic:
 * every component in these directories is `.tsx` and every helper and hook is
 * `.ts` (`ansi.ts`, `palette.ts`, `utils.ts`, `use-persisted-flag.ts`, …). So
 * "is this a component" needs no parsing of exports, and a hook cannot be
 * mistaken for one.
 *
 * Filesystem-only, on the same reasoning as `theme-tokens.spec.ts`: what is
 * being checked is which files exist, and jsdom can observe that nowhere.
