/*
 * The enclosure itself, spelled once. `SettingsPanel` and `SettingsList` are
 * the same surface with different SEMANTICS — a run of settings is a group of
 * controls, a run of saved configurations is a list — and a second copy of
 * these classes is how the two would come to disagree about a radius.
 *
 * `@container`: the rows fold at a CONTAINER width, not a viewport one. The
 * reading column this sits in is capped at 42rem and shares the window with a
 * nav column, so the viewport says nothing useful about how much room a row
 * actually has.
 *
 * No `overflow-hidden` here, deliberately: a `SettingsPanel` row may hold a
 * `Select`, whose panel is absolutely placed, and clipping it to the rounded
 * corners would cut the menu off at the row below. A list whose rows carry a
 * hover fill passes it at the call site instead.

/**
 * A settings SECTION's rows, enclosed and separated.
 *
 * The shape it replaces was a flat stack: a heading, a `flex` row holding the
 * control, then a muted `<p>` under the whole row at full width. Nothing tied a
 * description to the control it describes, and nothing marked where one setting
 * ended and the next began — so a section of three switches read as six loose
 * elements, and the eye had to re-derive the pairing on every line. Enclosing
 * them says which lines belong together, and the divider says how many settings
 * there are, both without a word of new text.
 *
 * NOT `SettingRow` next door, which is a different component for a different
 * layout: there the LABEL column is fixed and narrow (7rem) and the control
 * takes the rest, which is right for a dense inspector of pickers. Here the
 * label column is the wide one and the control is a fixed thing at the end,
 * which is what a page of switches and swatches needs. The two are inverses of
 * each other and neither can be expressed as a variant of the other without a
 * prop that flips which side grows.
