/**
 * The user's named agent configurations, as a list they can keep in order.
 *
 * A config directory is the profile a CLI runs as — its credentials, its
 * plugins, its history — and until now the app could only ever point a run at
 * one BY PATH. A user with three accounts picked between
 * `/Users/x/.claude-work`, `/Users/x/.claude-personal` and `/Users/x/.claude-lab`
 * by reading their tails. This is where a directory gets a name in the user's
 * own words and a colour that makes it recognisable without reading at all.
 *
 * It is drawn INSIDE the claude card in Settings rather than as a section of
 * its own — asked for there ("should be in claude settings menu"), and it is
 * the same rule the browser-tools switch beside it already follows: whatever is
 * true of one CLI lives on that CLI's card, or a reader looking for what they
 * can change about claude finds half of it under a heading that names a topic.
 *
 * Every edit PERSISTS AT ONCE through `onChange` — there is no Save button and
 * no draft. The card it sits in says "Changes are saved automatically", and a
 * list of four fields is not a form worth a commit step. The NAME is the one
 * field that commits on blur rather than per keystroke, which is what keeps a
 * rename from writing settings.json once per letter.
