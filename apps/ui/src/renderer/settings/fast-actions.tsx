 * folder, no agent and no model, so the same action is usable under whatever
 * setup the composer already carries.
 *
 * This is the second shape of the feature. The first bundled a whole new-chat
 * setup into each action — folder, branch, agent, model, approval mode — and
 * that was wrong twice over: it made every action usable in exactly one
 * configuration, and it gave the run's setup a second, invisible source that
 * moved chips the user had set by hand. The editor below is what is left once
 * that is taken out, and the smallness is the point rather than an omission.
